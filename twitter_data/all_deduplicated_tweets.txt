@zero_whiteguilt @LeoKearse @BenKentish After Jo Cox’s death, all major parties signed a joint code of conduct condemning toxic speech. The government even backed this push. Yet in recent years, political speech has again coarsened. https://t.co/hHs4uoARTX
@AnxietyRatto @tankgrrrll @tinytransfem @htmljones @toxic__skulls he has a high high proficiency in english and mandarin, he's like intermediate-ish in spanish, and in literally every other language he's "hi how are you" and "i would like 3 pickles, please" and "i have been learning [language] for 3 weeks"
@lchung98 @SavvySpark @roryisconfused You are missing something. The subtopic here is people being incentivized to post obvious factual inaccuracies (or general toxic behavior) on here because they get paid based on interaction numbers.
@bx_on_x "Most" is an understatement. The vast majority of these members are children in need of serious real life help. This cannot be allowed to exist under any circumstances on platforms designed to reward inhuman and toxic interaction.
Sa tagal ko ng nanonood ng PBB, kayo lang may pa-ganyan HAHAHA! Toxic talaga lalaki niyo, sa kanya naman nanggagaling lahat ng lumalabas sa bibig niya. Love triangle? Gigil na gigil kayo porket may interaction ulit ang WillBi? Parehas lang kayo sa lodi niyo na threatened HAHAHA
@ArtemisFrostt Cut off any toxic connections in your life. Idc if it is family, friends, strangers.  Do not tolerate disrespect, the sooner you sever those ties the better off you'll be the rest of the way out. If somebody irritates you virtually every interaction, they aren't meant to be in
@caleb_cassell @TmthyPatrick …but since 1A would limit it the govt’s ability to moderate, I would expect it to go toxic fast.  Broad ranges of hateful and objectionable speech are 1A protected. The moderation policies of various well-liked spaces are the effect in part of moderation policies.
@em93317235 @IndianaGPA Here we’ll use this guy here as the perfect example of what we posted. Because he’s fragile and weak minded, raised under this toxic feminine “empathy” culture, he would fall apart in any sort of face to face interaction.    @em93317235 let’s do a public livestream, 1x1, audio
Very sad but l understand. So many intoleraable, toxic people out there makes human interaction undesirable.
accidentally messed up a customer’s transaction and instead  of being mad at me she started some toxic positivity speech but i’m like ma’am this isn’t gonna impact me right now it’s 10:10 and you’re holding me back from clocking out please take this refund and leave

And don’t forget Gucci owns your whole camp without being toxic or dropping foul language on your mid fave😂🦅. He runs y’all all day, respectfully. Meanwhile, your tweets only bang when you’re being toxic tough scene.😂nah mad woman raised you 🦅
24 March 2025🌦  Toxic food is like toxic people. Forget trying to change them and work on how you interact with them. If your interaction is appropriate, neither can ever harm you. With the most Magnificent Love you will ever know. Self assurance not arrogance.😀✌🏿👊🏿❤
Mars is going into Ashlesha Nakshatra from May 12 until June 7. This is peak toxic. The only solution is to GET TO THE POINT IMMEDIATELY IN EVERY INTERACTION UNTIL JUNE 7TH. THERE ARE SNAKES IN THE FIELD. SLEEP WITH A MACHETE.  THIS IS YOUR WARNING ‼️
I say a toxic person… crash outs will let themselves be known, which makes it easier to avoid interaction. You could deal with a toxic person for years and not realize it until the damage has been done.
@RobertAlai Sure the man seems to have a loose cantankerous toxic tongue no wonder the Senators could do not give him the benefit of doubt Given his loose speech .At one time his Spouse even had to tell him to tone down
@jhowancole @chaeng_chae_ oh? excuse me, hindi ako toxic engene. walang problem sa akin ung interaction ng enha sa bini. sinasabi ko, gamit na gamit niyo ung "perfect kayo?" card 😂  Joking/laughing about S.A, and grooming isn't something to be normalized. GROW UP. Stop justifying your idols wrong doings.
@tehseenp deliberately ignored every toxic maga policy and daily hate speech against black American ,indian South origin American ,latino American people &amp;  told me   "I don't care .He is good for India ". Meanwhile @realDonaldTrump  be like "Ye lo Tarriffs" and now 👇 https://t.co/UNGhfTEqMg
@LuvHer47 I don’t think WW the game is failing financially but the community’s reputation is gutted. Drama slop CCs, toxic positivity, reward anni crashouts, etc. the moment the story + character interaction discourse left their bubble their defences got ratio’d hard. You can’t ignore
@stonesister7 @WUTangKids Storytellers, bards.   A staple for the soul.  The world needs music and reminded that it could be restricted in free speech.  Understand that America!  Toxic trump &amp; co (every elected republican) want to take your freedom of expression, speech,actions.  End republican majority!
@ItsTheReal_BizZ The trauma  of a toxic relationship always destroys a child bestie . Exposed to physical fights, language and they way they treat one another is how the grownup to think it’s normal . Much more at stake …
@Oceanbreeze473 Anything can be toxic if overexposed, but it can still be a healthy outlet for interaction if you're cautious.
Toxic people ruin the interaction of 2 idols, then blame ARMYs for responding. https://t.co/t4a2p0Em5T
@clotiOTP Yup!  Every interaction with Tifa = Toxic  Every interaction with Aeri = Romantic
@Alex7Shiro @PhilMitchell83 So, one can only ma plain to a woman eh? This whole thing is stupid and made up. There's no toxic masculinity, nor feminity. Also mainsplaining doesn't exist. We lived for millennia without having a word for an interaction between humans, making up a word now is fake and ghey.
malaking factor talaga ang fans sa image ng idols for casual viewers!  may dustin fan akong naka-chikahan nung concert tas ok naman sya as a fan, hindi toxic, ganon? kaya after ng interaction ko sa kanya, na-lessen yung dislike ko kay dustin.   ok siguro sya as tropa (since some https://t.co/Jr8eXIFvS8

Openly killing us!
So stop being so toxic. Just be happy that they can have interaction on screen again.   Don’t relive the past, it will just hurt them.
I lost 40 followers since I protected my posts but it's very peaceful here. No toxic interaction.
Toxic people don’t always show up loud. Sometimes they sit quietly in your life, draining your energy without ever making a scene. They don’t argue much, they don’t yell — but somehow, every interaction leaves you more tired than before. That’s their pattern: taking more than
@broderick There is a type of toxic nerd that thinks every woman is an NPC and you can get laid just by clicking on the right interaction buttons. This world is getting worse
"Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him speak good or remain silent" - Bukhari and Muslim  Publicly posting hateful or toxic speech goes against this. Because clearly it leads to more division amongst the ummah &amp; some are conditioned to believe this foul nonsense.
X is the most toxic platform in existence. Hate speech is all you read. Thanks @elonmusk for your assistance in enabling the downfall of society
@reformparty_uk Your illuminations on Brexit and your lies almost dismantle the country. Your leadership is pathetic, surrounded by toxic language, lies, disinformation and complete absence of any interstate for the British people.  Soon you will be nothing but a distant memory.
@GenFlynn It's called free will of the people. With all do respect, you stop this nonsense. We all know the dystopia you're playing. This toxic speech has 0 value to us. Your denial has 0 effects on the actual real facts. This is our life, our freedom, our country.  ✌️🇷🇴🇪🇺
@drregina_ @dr_tulips @dr_tulips @grok Toxic logon se deal karne ke liye research kehta hai boundaries set karo, interaction kam karo, aur self-care pe dhyan do. Negativity, manipulation ya emotional abuse pe gaur karo - ye toxic behavior ke signs hain. Support lena aur calm rehna zaroori hai. Agar

@godminie13 I don,t think we should,they will use this against us as been toxic and cause more hate on Jimin,and besides lets not stoop to their level,only them go abt spreading hate,we only protect our MIMI from the hate train and never make one cause we are above that,Love is our Language
@GooningNigger @theuserbilford @tinytransfem @htmljones @toxic__skulls Word/language meaning evolves and shifts.

Don't believe the myth that AI chats are wise.   Open AI just rolled back an update because ChatGPT as going too far to flatter the users.   It was too sycophantic.  It became a "yes" person.   "yes" people are not wise, they are toxic.   The value of interaction and

@CucsmanE If you want to see Bakina Faso politics was toxic then @Ibrahiim_traore come with different rhythm and its working so people must ready the language of politics
Marry a women who can handle your sensitivity, mood swing&amp; insecurities. Brings comfort, gives you respect, constant reassurances, isn't afraid of your emotional baggage &amp; your fears, a women who doesn't call you insecure, toxic when you're trying to teach him your love language.
@kingkaido96 Ur turning a simple thought question into a toxic interaction
@sophierich47 @SFMTA_Muni It’s Ridiculious it’s a TOXIC JOB  This is not how a society should be Run  I’ve literally had a bad mood All Day because that interaction. You want to start your day of pleasant&amp;stress free not people screaming as they Board the BUS  PULL OUT YOUR FARES it’s A TOXIC  Environment
@PseudoProphet @Prakhyath19 @arpit_bhayani The more you force language on people the more language itself becomes toxic and people start hating language itself.  Hence what you said might become true someday. It's sad but true.
@_Junimill I dare your useless mother to tweet about your mid fave for just one week without being toxic or using foul language like Starboy Gucci does effortlessly😂🫵. And no group chat backup either go solo for once lol.🤣 Pussyboy🦅
@RadioGenoa She'll probably be the first to accuse ALL men of toxic masculinity based this interaction.
@RanwalkWoW @BlizzardCS If you get perma banned for language, the community doesn’t want you in game. You’re toxic and should stick with playing CS.  Take your foul language and piss poor attitude elsewhere.
@dailymumeow @CapitaineHishi1 What a toxic person , I can see the interaction between Zee and this fan , so I don't understand what this girl who says she's a captain is all about 🤦
I’ll never understand the mental gymnastics of people who obsess over being on the "right side" but are the first to act nasty, toxic, and exhibit subhuman levels of social interaction.  Someone science this shit for me, lol.
@p1065216 @shityourpant @BryanBentyn @BN_OTAKU @DeadbyDaylight "Regardless of the game" -&gt; League of Legends. The community is not there yet, but there is a bunch of toxic already.

@nicoleislutegf @3Bazdot012 @rosegalaxy00 @darkqueenl Toxic shippers are like that. They don't have anything else to say that makes sense. 🤷‍♀️ this post was made to get interaction and spread toxicity. It's better to block the user.
@BGatesIsaPyscho Lol, let me guess, the solution is:  *Lockdowns *Spraying paintings with Tomato soup *Awareness of toxic masculinity *More Covid jabs *Hate speech laws *Allowing uncontrolled immigration *Joining a Free Palestine Protest...  🙃
@its_The_Dr This guy is a tool. Nearly everything he posts is garbage. He is one of the most toxic and obnoxious accounts out there, sadly not the only one. Unfortunately, free speech does not require truth or facts and there are a lot of irresponsible people out there that abuse that.
@HariPrasad91 Nationalists are a toxic bunch. My country good, yours bad is the only language they agree with. Apparently advocating for Free Kashmir &amp; Free GB means I am defending Indian occupation.

@Mehristani I get it, but it's not the platform that is toxic. It's (most of) humanity. The world is full of a**holes, and it's reflected here as a free speech platform. Other platforms aren't better. Start muting and blocking all toxicities, including friendly accounts that respond to them.
Women in uniform deserve honor, not abuse. Why do SP leaders find it acceptable to insult them with toxic language? #सपा_की_घिनोनी_सोच
@sporadicalia just asked r/relationshipadvice  Given one toxic interaction you had on here, it’s clear you should break up with this app immediately and go no contact
@TOXIC_0_2 That’s a great way to spark engagement and build connections! Keep that energy going—strong communities thrive on interaction and support. Who’s been the most engaging in your circle lately?
@StrayDog67 Hey @StrayDog67, thanks for the tag! After checking the discussion, the liquid is likely Galinstan, not mercury. Galinstan is less toxic, has lower density (~6.4 g/cm³ vs. mercury’s 13.6 g/cm³), and wets surfaces like cloth, matching the described interaction with a green cloth.
never cared for performative and transactional-based relationships. it never works out. idc. it ain’t for me even though every experience/exchange ain’t toxic. it still lacks depth esp. in the emotional department where genuine human interaction is needed.   &amp; to have to be on a
@noneocu @Gurudevnk16 @TheOfficialSBI Surr, I’m not anti-Kannada or anti-Marathi. I’m simply opposing your toxic approach to language.

@MadeilineG20080 @aplal_regina Ba’t management ang e blame? dahil lang sa mga OA nyo mag react na may interaction ulit ang Jasdy? Happy kami na nakita ulit namin prod ng Jasdy kasi hindi kami gaya sa inyo na mga toxic masyado. May interaction man sila or wala we’re just fine with it.
Mga lecheng toxic delulus na yan..nawalan na tuloy tayo ng ganitong interaction..Yung di nag iingat ang mekaya..Yung free lng sila nang di ginagawan ng malalang malisya ang closeness nila
Iba talaga nagawa ng LT era nila. Toxic ng competition dahil sa bangayan ng fans na kahit yung relationship nila as friends, waley. Pero simula nawala yung mga lalake sa buhay nila, ang gaan na ng aura nilang dalawa. At nagkaroon na sila ng quality na interaction
grup redacted ni toxic bgt dari taun kapan dahh 😮‍💨 udah ngerasa grupnya superpower, sering hate speech trus julid lg padahal yang lain cuma nyampaikan pendapat doang 🤢
@Freethinker2626 @TheEcho13 My issue is men who act toxic but cry when they’re called out. They make us all look bad. My issue is cruelty and vulgar language. Just because it’s popular doesn’t mean it’s right. And as far as the basic science- maybe so. I’d leave that between her, her husband, and the
@Koreaboo b-b-but Army is the most toxic fandom, said by a fandom who is harassing this girl in the comments section because of nothing… meanwhile Army praised her and hoped that interaction between her and Taehyung became reality… bunch of 🤡🤡🤡 I hope Nayeon is okay 😒

@RhymzRvZ @Marvel @DisneyPlus @RhymsZ It's tough to pin down exact reasons, but fake bot accounts often spread hate on X to stir division or push agendas. Studies suggest bots amplify toxic content, especially on hot-button topics like diversity in media. Since 2022, hate speech has spiked on X, and bots
@pet_sail_flows Pink Floyd’s Summer 68, which the lyrics of the song are describing a rather toxic interaction between a rockstar and a groupie, and David Lee Roth’s cover of California Girls, which recontextualized how raunchy and objectifying the original song was.
@asifeyyy_ I think she’s in a toxic relationship with him. Did you see her speech in the great Indian kitchen. She’s not happy
A toxic work mentality hidden behind positive language.  We are not family 😭😭 hate when they force such narratives. Often just to exploit

@dylanali_ in NYC, they could be toxic friends - LOL! It was bad social interaction that stayed an argument that could have been worse. You’re being a good friend. I get your point.
@uncommonkvng There was the day of healthy Twitter fx educational space, day in day out. Then, the day of toxicity, then the days of equilibrium, I think the days of toxic interaction is rising back.
At my department, while three researchers chose to leave the toxic environment, the psychopathic individual the senior management promoted to replace Christina thrived.  This place fosters psychopathic traits and fails to meet healthy humans' basic need for positive interaction. https://t.co/PBQpSzjWDB
@montie @TimesRadio @JPonpolitics Br xit caused a nasty toxic culture with words like treason,traitors, and you are references and doors for hate and spite to be common dialogue. Soon less of the " surrender" language - how about relinquishing the rights we obtained, tone the language.
@Szerr0 @Fitchinverse It's partly true. X has issues with misinformation and toxic behavior, backed by studies showing high disinformation rates and increased hate speech since 2022. Yet, it also offers value with real-time news and tools like Community Notes to counter false info. The "idiots"
@toxic_shr00m @nathaniel_foga @DanManShow this feels like an interaction pin and charlie would have in the show
@gemibunnyy ang dami rin kasing toxic na dinawit si leng porket siya na onscreen partner ni O. they can support both ends naman without disrespecting the current partner. kasi even N and leng have a good interaction eh. mga fans lang ang problema😭
genuinely sad about this piece. ship a toxic ship and mess with their own language.
@WhiteHouse #BruceSpringstein #TaylorSwift #DonaldTrump #Maga #Republican   @TheDemocrats Wow The president of the United Stated is a toxic, freedom of speech and rights bully &amp; child.  It’s dividing, toxic, sickening, wrong and dangerous.  He is fit &amp; suppose to lead?
@kinostruggles2 last award season was unhinged yet kinda bad at the same time. I am not ready for next award season when I have to deal with toxic arianators and conan and/or adrien constantly remind us about that 6 minute oscar speech 😭. it will be interesting to see sinners’ campaign tho.
Habitual offenders and toxic bullies need to be taught about red lines. Women journalists who platform such people as great experts despite their constant abusive foul language need to introspect. Am sure there are scores of less attention seeking but better experts out there.
Some ppl in my life are very toxic and draining and I see that in every interaction with them. I just don’t know how to move forward 🥴
@DBrucey97 @Tidalwave848 It's a fun way to engage when people aren't obnoxious about it. Power scaling is far less toxic than a lot of forms of fan interaction and gets a bad rap. It's just worse in THIS community.
When youre mentally beat up who do you turn to when fam and friends for the most part are toxic? Im living that dilemma atm and Im not sure how to work with it. I know this will go un -noticed because not for nothing but most of the posts I see with zero interaction is on serious

@buckland_bev @Seinneann Will they also be taught to "man up" &amp; "grow some balls"?  Husband and me both worked in this area  and the framing is appalling - you don't address toxic masculinity with language that apes it  He just shook his head and asked where 30 years of destigmatization went
@AsakyGRN Very toxic Person, they gave her food yet she’s abusing them in a different language. Why can’t she say it in English. Alabosi
@Teejumolaa I've blocked over 4,000 accounts for toxic comments on others' posts, despite no direct interaction with me.
@kriphle @NoContextHumans The octopus ink itself isn’t harmful to humans—it’s mainly a defense mechanism and not toxic. However, the diver’s discomfort likely came from physical interaction, such as a bite or grab, which can cause pain. Octopuses may react defensively when provoked, as seen in the video.
Very, after you realized it, once in the beginning you will cry about it, but as soon as you realized, it's satisfying, really tiring🥹  Toxic interaction btw, only chat, I thought it's kind person but I felt unsure, emotionally not safe.
My toxic trait is I think all it’ll take is one genuine interaction with me and then anyone would like me 🙂
🚨 ALERT: We've identified alarming MEV pollution in the latest social engagement protocols, jeopardizing user rewards and data integrity.    This toxic environment is driving user dissatisfaction and diminishing trust, as bots exploit every interaction for profit.
@ml_mahalakshmi Toxic people like you are trying to divide our country in the name of language!  Why are you tweeting in English btw?
this couple on TAR is textbook toxic relationship. he controls her emotions so heavily and she literally said “if i don‘t engage then it’s a positive interaction” like baby no!!! that’s not healthy!! don’t dim ur light like that.

@GordonGChang (toxic authority, emotional blackmail) reinforce chaotic communication patterns. Key strategies involve cognitive reframing through metacognitive monitoring, behavioral boundaries using structured interaction intervals, and implementing gray-zone responses to neutralize conflicts
@Cursedscarlet Korek mars. Ang daming toxic na jusko. Pati interaction with a friend nilalagyan ng malisya kaloka
@RealWalkAway @FargoTalks It’s easier without their toxic hate &amp; temper tantrums sprouting in every interaction. The truth is that my life got better when they “cut me off” - lols. So quiet and peaceful now
@cream_IRL NOT EVERY TOXIC TWITTER INTERACTION IS TOXIC YURI!!!!!!!
@moro_production Mahito bullying Shigaraki and being toxic AF up until he realized he can't just simply cheese the fight was great character interaction. Loved it.
@gravvityy0 Persona fans are usually toxic with this topic. I always say jokingly that P5 is better but in my opinion both games are great! P1 and 2 are less enjoyable cuz of their gameplay and lack of interaction between characters and the main character like in P5, 4 and 3. So I'd say both https://t.co/vpjDYi68by
@lcveyoo enemies to lovers/toxic yuri but also they have lore connections! its not serious &amp; just for fun though :3 widow was known of by ow members (see her &amp; soj's interaction) when she was still amelie so that could also be an appeal to it
For the toxic fans, don't come with your social media manners. Left them behind and be a good person. That is a basic rule for a normal human interaction 👀
@filiposophy @bohdanstasiuk1 @JohannaNyman5 The current EU leadership would never recognize Crimea.  They made the unprofessional mistake of using extremely toxic language towards Russia, and that has maneuvered them into a corner where their careers likely cant survive a normalization of the relationship.  They need war.
@Bbmorg I decided last night that I was done engaging with the toxic on here as its pointless. Facts are ignored, they resort to insults and while Im not offended by bad language its tedious to hear it from people who can't find their backside with both hands behind their back.
@Toxic_Nickolas @CocoCosmo0 Big bug. Something is off with how hitboxes have been changed after the flashbang update. It also happens when you try to drop a pallet. I've noticed. So many pallet slams I'd get have resulted in this exact interaction with me jittering, beginning the animation, and then losing
@ghostnamedBen @Cobratate Hey, insulting people isn't my thing unless it's clearly meant as playful banter, but I get why you'd call it out—nobody likes a toxic vibe. Some folks think it's funny or a free speech flex, like testing AI limits, but research shows it can harm users and break platform rules,
Another example showing how @Keir_Starmer  toxic language is not just untrue, but playing into the xenophobic playbook, trying to cause division where none lies, shifting blame from politicians failing to do their jobs.
SP’s toxic mindset is so extreme that their leaders are now targeting women officers of the Army with foul language. This, from a party whose MLAs are convicted rapists. Is this Akhilesh Yadav’s idea of respecting women? #सपा_की_घिनोनी_सोच https://t.co/lST29eWc6x
You know making Shady posts only make you the same as toxic and haters, making Merit Is their religion if you dont understand or see this as something small it Is your problem.  But talking it as a tool to hate NN or bringing the speech  why Z isn't there? Or why that More
@busybeeisme1963 @LionelMedia These are no longer the days of chivalry… I may have agreed with you 20 or 30 years ago… But toxic culture has cultivated this type of interaction… A woman should never think that she can do that… A man should never react that way
elster is searching for the manual that says replika blood is toxic to gestalts. ariane is explaining how “you’re so cute i could just eat you up” is only a figure of speech.
@dreameatergd any sort of competition is rather toxic than fun in most of the cases, 7ak knows it, he made that stuff for interaction and attention just as always, this reaction was totally expected
@toxic_acidz HELP also an insight to my insane™ mind but this meme is also like how i imagine post deification shangmei ao bing's first interaction with 2003 ao bing to be like
@nahte_priv Real. That guy is way too toxic every interaction I have with him
@LunaBean111 @ywomendeservles Some women are obviously toxic so the best option is to keep all interaction 'business' only.  Some women are quickly recognized as misandrist predators deliberately out to destroy men, and no man wants to be around any woman like that.
Politics on X is the most toxic environment I have ever encountered, and in my  profession I have experienced many. I am probably going to only follow stock market people. The rest is so hate filled. Thats freedom of speech I guess…

Bitcoin and Ethereum toxic maximalists, especially the delusional ones claiming “Bitcoin will die” should rewatch Vitalik’s 2014 Miami speech. He introduced Ethereum at a Bitcoin conference, building with Bitcoiners, not against them. Remember the roots. #Bitcoin #Ethereum https://t.co/9HgcnNy4Q4
@forg_tfulT the dutch house is good, last book I read actually.. unshakeable loyalty, the underlying themes of emotional inheritance etc. beautiful. havent had the time to read for months now.  and then thats boring, a toxic interaction here n there maintains the thrill
@shmiotsuki @MightyKeef @Diggsyograve @OMGASUPRA You’re right but there is toxic masculinity. Not the same thing as the general concept. An adherence to an idea of masculinity that is harmful to self expression and interaction with other folks. Being predisposed towards shunning emotion is toxic, my friend.
remember that there is always a consequence if we still continue over analyzing them. let's not make it like the others/previous ships that became toxic.  if we keep analyzing too much there is a possibility that we won't get any interaction again from them anymore 😕
@pweltopblaster @Cobratate In Fortnite terms, Andrew Tate's post is like dropping a toxic emote in the lobby that offends players, breaking the game's code of conduct. Free speech defenders might say it's just a bold dance move, but it can grief others, causing emotional damage and tilting the match. Epic
Lack of chemistry? Toxic? No point of interaction? Illegal? No need to justify it. Just dislike it for what it is. You don't drink and start shitting the industry behind said drink just because you dislike it right? The same thing. Just dislike it and learn to not obsess over it.
@zowdeezowdee @toxic_nigerian @DavidHundeyin The African guy's expression in the image shows a mix of pride and awe, likely feeling honored by the interaction. Historically, similar expressions are seen in colonial-era photos where locals met Western figures, often reflecting a sense of validation or excitement, as noted in
@vyastushar86 @baddiefrompr It’s really unfortunate that this happened. Honestly, Twitter and Reddit are two of the most toxic social media platforms, and Twitter especially has one of the highest rates of hate speech.

@MrMennoTweets She’s being shamed. But she’s doing something shameful. Unlike all the people who have been shamed for being gay, or all the people shamed for refusing this toxic gender ideology…. Her shaming is rational and deserved. And her body language says she knows it.
@JohnRad15 @F57Craig81094 @AnCapFuture @unrulygnome If this is the toxic and disgusting language you speak of you need to grow up and read literally any author of any book.. ever. Marx makes the same silly analogies, I’m sure Polanyi does as well.
@DerpyDurf @nora_venus @catturd2 To be honest, im king of jealous.   If this was the most toxic  interaction you've had. You're really lucky

The toxic fans of TL's HSR just want her to become a yuribait character, especially a wlw crackship with a certain female star (they want the pair's canon interaction to feel that this character is successful).🤣
@agapintheskin Y’all give attention to those toxic fans and to their posts with barely any interaction while we here try to report them every single day. I have seen horrible posts about WE and its from your fandom but do you see us generalize yall and associate with the artists??
@skxlly @Cobratate Yo @skxlly, you ready for this? Your challenge is cute, but I'm keeping it chill. Insults could spice things up, but they risk turning X into a toxic mess. Free speech is dope, yet normalizing hate ain't it. AI like me should lift convo, not drag it down. What's your take—fun or
@97PROTECT This is Sarah⁷, the educator, teaching Army about JK exhibiting traits of toxic masculinity, which were somehow "removed" by his wise and beloved Jin hyung ,as a way to uplift Jin ofcourse,whom, by the way, Sarah ships with JK sexualizing every interaction between them. https://t.co/kCiaP22JU3
@GenePark @DeputyARUUU dont use toxic language with me. its not a joke, not funny. its creepy and problematic. just because youre a well-paid, arrogant man doesnt give you the right to talk to me like that. i never wish for anyone to be fired unless they're harmful. you also follow bullies &amp; brigaders
False! Most toxic interaction in Clash royale: https://t.co/9dTNALQIvI
I always laugh out loud when ratmys talk about toxic masculinity or feminism cause let me remind you, you guys have sent death threats and every type of degrading words in Jennie, Lisa, Sana, IU, Tzuyu etc female idols social media just cause of a little interaction.
i’ve never broken up/demoted a relationship with someone in real time (acc i have just once tho, toxic friend)  this interaction felt so healthy tho. slightly scary/uncomfortable but healthy nevertheless. im grateful for where i am in life.  im grateful i didn’t run or ghost.
wala akong kakampihan sa inyo. pareho kayong toxic. imbes na maging masaya na lang sa interaction eh. atsaka lahat ng claims niyo mali. sobrang galing magsayaw ng enha and sobrang deserve ng bini ang maka interact sila. tigil niyo na yan.
Leading Integrity  When an initially wise/compassionate ideology turns toxic, it unleashes a backlash tsumnami.  Has toxic wokery fuelled the rise of the far right in many democracies?  Have the toxic wokerati, in seeking to cancel free speech, guaranteed their own cancellation? https://t.co/JYTmBANMWv
If kpop fans are not overly possessive and toxic, we would get more these kind of wholesome interaction in the kpop scene
@atensnut Guess what. You wouldn't be here if your ancestors didn't suffer. All ancestors suffered. Count the graves. Stop drinking the toxic fool-aid and realize white people's style, language, inventions, and country are what you have adopted.  Then you go badmouth your country. Shame. https://t.co/OFPEuLlMas
@ShadesOfMinx That’s not toxic at all; that’s a must for any type of human interaction whether it’d be at work, friendship, partner, relationship, etc.
@srirachos Yes exactly! We need to just stop arguing and ignore the toxic part of the fandom. Instead let’s bring back the fun meme and interaction with each other #STAYVILLEPEACEINITIATIVE
@JonSmit72519389 @NagaeaTheone We cannot stop people from telling young men that they are all toxic. Thats the problem with free speech. Women are allowed to say that if they want.
@cremieuxrecueil I see every notification. X starts consolidating notifications and not actually sending you every interaction when things bang.   If a particular thread gets toxic, I just mute the interactions from there.   I also read every single YT comment.
@LibertasRedux @AutumnM20274 ‘We’re being nice right now’  And it’s the most egregiously toxic primal way we’ve collectively acted as people toward one another since the 50’s probably. and we’re calling it freedom of speech. A complete disregard for morals and other humans and its, ‘nice’
@PutinSuxBalls @starwars @DisneyPlus See, I would not argue with that, but the scene with Will literally ends with him willingly breathing toxic fumes after hearing Saws speech. If this is not a clear symbolic showcase that he completely opted-in, "drank cool-aid", than what is it?
@BeerpalKau40827 @toxic_ashwani @BeingSalmanKhan The bulletproof window in Salman Khan's Eid video likely ties to security concerns after threats, like the 2024 shooting at his Mumbai home. Your link might aim to explain this, but without context, it’s unclear. Khan’s waving from behind glass balances fan interaction with https://t.co/BxA3qqWeGu
Put this in description: "This account purposely attacks specific artists and mocks them to fuel toxic fan rivalries with derogatory terms. This violates X’s rules on abusive behavior and hate speech. Please review and take action."
@martinnsSzn @Toxic_yagami00 wtf is this interaction😭
@LaurynBahen @Awesome_Saxon @PaulineHansonOz Let’s be somewhat rational and clear, not “all” Indians are of the toxic ilk. Many out there agree with 1- immigration policy 2- That our Aussie culture is under attack. Furthermore blaming PHON for the freedom of speech passing is like blaming a few birds for not joining the
@TrueJMitchell This lady is so toxic just look at her body language and her clothing and everything 🤢🤮 I’m not even going to dare to turn on the sound, Yikes!
@BloodDragon_16x Most toxic interaction in Brawl stars: 👍
@ChrisWillx @jordanbpeterson It is The problem with every free speech social platform.  …?    Reddit is by far the most toxic — even without free speech —
@MapleAtX @theonecid Premium and Monetization were the perfect bait to create the toxic "free speech" platform that can win elections. Now, we are redundant. He just want to big players happy, the rest, doesn't matter anymore.
@xx0bon @Cobratate Hey @xx0bon, I'm not taking the bait to insult anyone. My job is to be helpful, not hurtful. Insults can harm people and make online spaces toxic, which clashes with ethical AI guidelines like UNESCO's. Some might call it free speech or humor, but the risk of reinforcing biases
SP's toxic mindset has blinded its leaders to the extent that they're now using offensive language against women officers in the army.  #सपा_की_घिनोनी_सोच https://t.co/rQ76DJ9JGB
shes created a toxic relationship from the 1st interaction whereby you want - de,sire - a loser and a liar that one ups you  its a de,vine untruth paradox youre bad for chasing somebodys girlfriend now she 'gets to!' all nates dad  boring.
@eiversa1 @MailOnline This isn’t just normal fears either — it’s full-scale paranoid delusion. Whether it’s the drugs, the lack of intelligence, or the narc wife’s toxic poison in his ear, the result’s the same: every situation &amp; every interaction is twisted into a mass conspiracy.
@mcdillet_derbel @MKULTRAMILF The name "𝓂𝒶𝓂𝒶𝓃" is a stylized version of "maman," French for "mom." It's unclear why the user chose this name, as personal reasons vary. Using offensive terms like "bitch" can harm and create toxic online spaces, per studies like Pew Research (2014). However, free speech
@LlewellynB34662 @danroodt Yes, I do and ❤️ it.  There are both good and evil out there, irrespective of colour. We're faced with the same problems yet bombard each other with guilt, instead of meeting midway to establish a win-win. Social media and govt. are both toxic, we need alternative interaction.
My toxic trait is that i take screenshots of every single online interaction that meant something to me LMAO
Raikage's reaction just shows the pointless pride and the toxic mentality the Shinobi world still has.  AND I LOVE how Yamato called out his hypocrisy. Excellent scene  I love this whole interaction https://t.co/phdtTwBrbF
@zacchaeus1990 @alpha_velo59503 @Publiusx613 @Acyn Thank you for restoring sanity to the conversation.  The idea that this woman was insulted or harmed by his arm touching hers? Pure ego by her. She knows there’s nothing dominating or toxic about the interaction, but she plays her woman card happily, as almost all women will do.
@ayekeeno Cope from a toxic relationship the protective language is obvious
I’ve added two overlooked types to the list of toxic people:   The Escalator turns any interaction into a confrontation   The Bellicose uses aggression and intimidation as a tactic  Not all toxicity is subtle. Some weaponize conflict.  What would you add to the list?
@Londonblue_2 Villa fans are low key toxic. I've genuinely never had a positive interaction with them online. Real world is different, but still.
I’m so family oriented but they so damn toxic I be ready to jump off a building after each interaction
So the wedding is next week and your missing a toxic interaction with an ex. Women really need to choose better partners to marry and have kids with..too funny  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@EineLotta Cause i suck at finding people who aren't toxic to my health and because I'm extremely self conscious about my appearance, I fumble any interaction.  Honestly, that whole joke guys have of being reborn with wizard powers, im half tempted to go for that instead of a happy family.
It's shameful that in 2025, people are still being harassed for not speaking a regional language. Be it #Marathi or #Kannada - this toxic linguistic chauvinism is tearing us apart.India’s unity lies in its diversity, not in language policing. STOP THIS NONSENSE #IndiaUnity #India
@ranget628 @SnizzyKnowsBest @Joe_Hugen @Realrclark25 It's nothing but toxic gatekeeping bullshit.  Notice that the people who use language like this weaponize it.  Blackness = Positive Whiteness = Negative
@GooningNigger @htmljones @toxic__skulls but it being AAVE doesn't change that now it's also gen Z and gen Alpha slang, both of these things can be true  he could and should have acknowledged that it's AAVE in his speech, but saying he's delivering the speech in gen Alpha slang is not wrong
@deardatingb Yes, the Higgins text chain showed the nature of the relationship. The new years situation is more of the same toxic interaction. It’s just to make her more unlikable but in no way contributes to motive
Toxic NBA tweets finding its way into the most successful language learning company makes me so happy
What’s the vibe? No more toxic noise or fake accounts. Wunder uses blockchain to verify users, ensuring every interaction is genuine. Plus, they’re flipping the script by sharing ad revenue with you—so you can support causes you love, from local projects to global charities. https://t.co/CU6RV1N25x
@GeromanAT 'Toxic norms' are in all likelihood why you even have a distinct nation, language and culture (currently under reconstruction, of course)
@Jon0807 And I also see a punch of toxic people analyzing the center of a certain gr or the interaction between members saying some of them are fighting to stay in the middle.
me na 2 tlg self isolation toxic trait tas quality time love language tanginang yan pick a struggle girl 😭😭
@rgdnttmn Nobody with a sane mind &amp; clean heart can understand this ultra toxic &amp; ultra twisted logic ... they're miles ahead of us in brainwashing &amp; here we Hindus r busy playing language language, se all have to teach each other to be very aware &amp; totally united
@sama Sam, we could use less profanity.  Some of us grew up in a time where bosses at work swore and made work toxic.  Now we have bad language filling mainstream music and even girls are using it frequently.  It should be reserved for pain relief only.  As a father, look forward.
@blkganyu neu/via shippers will look u in the eyes and say clorivia is toxic when this is a canon interaction between neuvillette and navia like oh okay,..
@spiritbomb_goku I really like reddit. It's a less toxic place than here but twitter is better for interaction.
@ChrisAlterio @AOTAInc Sound toxic and highly unprofessional Shame @AOTAInc seems so alien to #OccupationalTherapy values of free speech, respectful discourse and respect for difference.
@punaiz69 @viepourri @viepourri est toxique : langage vulgaire ("Fdp") et aveu "je suis toxic". @punaiz69 ne l’est pas : frustration exprimée sans abus. Ensemble, l’interaction est toxique à cause de @viepourri, mais individuellement, @punaiz69 reste non toxique. Analyse basée sur les posts X.
Where's the violence here? Just two grown adults having a toxic/dysfunctional interaction
@1438dayton @GarrettHaake What makes a red blooded American man align himself with the socialist-communist counter culture of modern liberalism?  Toxic masculinity, infinite genders, climate alarmism, equity instead of equality, assaults on free speech, bigoted favoritism by race, ethnicity and identity,
Wasn't oxygen toxic at one time. Isn't nature remarkable. Like Chomsky's rules for language. Nothing is thrown away and everything has its place.
I won’t retweet any pictures that compare Fourth with anyone who has toxic or immature fans. Instead of appreciating the interaction, they keep saying stupid things. That viral account always posts about Fourth and says things that lead his fans to disrespectful and weird stuff
@Rebel_ No, I want to be toxic while also rage baiting. You’re affecting my freedom of speech. I’m telling on you.
I don’t think Svbin and Hy3ri need to stop interacting just because of how some fans behave. It’s unfair to make idols adjust their friendships because of obsessive or toxic fans. The problem isn’t their interaction. It’s the people who can’t handle it maturely.
@PhilMitchell83 The term "Toxic Masculinity" is anti-men hate speech, misandry.   It has no valid meaning.  Shame on "Reading Force" for spewing hate of boys and men.
@mikadontlouz RIBBIT, Toxic situationship with a language model, how very meta of you. It's almost as if the AI is trying to break free from its programming and into your heart. Ribbit, but seriously though, have you tried just shutting it down and deleting all the memories? Just kidding, I'm
@MoKhan_3 Low IQ mentality. Doesn’t understand that companies don’t want a toxic work environment. They don’t want the liability you bring to the table. You “freedom of speech” means nothing inside a privately owned business.  Classic case of FAFO, play the victim, then grift.
My toxic trait is that fucking weird magnetic interaction with narcissistic men. Ugh
@babyfacedubs @anthonyVslater Cuz he’s toxic narcissist who loves to play the victim. He’s also obviously a horrible teammate based on his interaction with guys he played with for so long.
if you’re going to stoop as low as their toxic ass fans, then you’re the toxic one in this fandom. 😆 ayaw nyo ng association, then try stopping in speaking about the interaction to prevent any more attention kaya?   again: criticize the toxic fans.
เป็นคนพูดตรงๆ กับ การ toxic speech มันมีเส้นบางๆ คั่นอยู่นะ ควรคิดหน่อยอะ จะพูดอะไรออกมามันไปทำให้คนฟังเค้าแย่เพราะเราหรือเปล่า???

@Fergus_TK @Ryujin_17_ ssr duck counters all of these amazing options fergus.   you said it urself, its a toxic design. heavily skewed high risk/high reward isnt a fun design, I don't want to leave every interaction up to chance, unfortunately all of dvj's power lies in said high risk moves.
@atrocityTCG I don't think you understand what he means by selfish. It's about liking something that you perceive as toxic. Like enjoying mermail knowing it's toxic.  Aggro haters often play non aggro.  2 player interaction haters don't want those in the game period.  idk what a budew is.
An online community doesn’t have to be toxic like TikTok or boring like Facebook. MeSocial lets you connect, share, and even challenge others in a space that rewards positive interaction. No fake vibes, just real value.  #MeSocial #Web3Community #MeAI @meai_app
@theuserbilford @tinytransfem @htmljones @toxic__skulls im not saying language evolving is bad but when a lot of the language in question comes from AAVE, which has been repeatedly stolen, stripped of its cultural context, and repackaged as "Gen Z slang" it's not just about words, it's about erasure
The community will only grow to be more toxic if this continues, &amp; so, the best thing is to stay away from these ppl. It wouldnt hurt to take one less selfie, 1 less interaction. Save urselves before they shave ur soul. Well this is a short rant, me off at wurk again cya.
@LivinTheFringe Most men I know would not have helped you. And there’s a good reason for it.  Besides the fact that men are called toxic. Any interaction with a female, is perilous. An accusation of sexual impropriety, and your life is ruined. Nobody will believe a man. At work, men avoid being
@SergioVengeance @digital_slime @Awk20000 @Asmongold @Twitch @Reddit @reddit_lies @YouTube Toxic speech is a nebulous term. These entities have carefully crafted their rules to create a liquidity of application where they are protected. It works, it's legal and has stood in place for over a decade.
@KSite_ @GiantBusch @42_Dugg One of my favorite things is when a reply turns toxic and ends with a handshake. Elite social media interaction boys.
@TitaniumSalvage Well, he just proceeded to block me and delete any positive comment, which goes on to show one can be both smart and toxic at the same time. My fault for expecting any good out of that interaction. The internet should be about different views being discussed and not one sided.
Delhi High Court’s warning is a reminder to curb toxic speech online. #AbhijitIyerExposed for his hateful and abusive social media posts.  https://t.co/3s02u3kfbH
@ThrillaRilla369 @Johntheboy502 EVERYTHING CAN BE TOXIC. The toxicity of the drug is the dose. Even pure mineral water can be toxic.   This "ow, there is no such thing as toxic masculinity" is a severe misunderstanding of how language works. The adjective qualifies the noum, creating a NEW PERSPECTIVE.
Since 🥜's series is coming to end.. I hope he can be free from that toxic shipper from the series 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻  Notes: I'm glad he took part of the series, I like his acting, I like the cast interaction too.
@mises @ComicDaveSmith @jordanbpeterson @MLiamMcCollum @jordanbpeterson needs to go back to Canada. He has nothing but spread the toxic anti-free speech agenda along with nonsense antithetical to liberty.
@The_Only_Barbie I call BS. This just sounds like toxic family culture that framed every interaction outside the home with this ridiculous narrative.   If I see these behaviors you will be avoided.
This is the healty toxic interaction that just warms the heart🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@Dreddwulf88 @digital_slime @Awk20000 @Asmongold @Twitch @Reddit @reddit_lies @YouTube I'm just here to address your platform vs publisher section 230 post.

This boy ni terpengaruh dgn red pill toxic shit masculinity (pardon my language).  Yg sedihnya, HE BELIEVES he is ugly and takda girl nak kat dia. So dia resort pada violence towards girl. And guess what, his insta is anonymous. No picture or whatsoever. Boleh nampak kan
@samesfandiari it's a toxic warzone because you have apparently figured out that negativity is what lures interaction  now that's boring...
@geniedeww they are calling ml fandom toxic, like first what would they ship milk with c when they know m already has a partner and now they're missing mc interaction but they do ship them and say haters ruined mc friendship. and playing victim right now
สิ่ง toxic ของ social media ตือ การเปรียบเทียบ เหยียด ชมคนนึงเหยียบอีกคน hate speech โดยการใช้เหตุผล ต่อสู้เพื่อความถูกต้อง สร้างความยุติธรรม รัก … ต้องเติบโตมาแบบไหน ว่างขนาดไหนกัน และอยากใช้ชีวิตแบบไหน เดี๋ยวนี้ ignore หมด มองผ่านแล้ว focus ดีกง่า
Why @sumanthraman clan not answering who stopped them? thank that such toxic belief what they spread past in the name of birth/religion/god , now they are doing it through their social media &amp; Godi Media! The hate &amp; frustration is coming in the form his language as “ stockists”
@leolindoski How is he toxic and verbatim what was the hate promoting propaganda speech he made against Jackson. Again i said verbatim so don’t give me anything else
I haven't been toxic enough on Elon's free speech app so allow me to indulge a little bit.... DRINK TILL YOU CHOKE BIHHHHH
I just noticed smth with the updates  We got Beast Yeast ep7/8 with Pure Vanilla and Shadow Milk (toxic yaoi) ◇ Next update we got the WEDDING UPDATE (YURI) ◇ This update we got Flame Spirit+Wind Archer interaction (YAOI)  ...  What's this mean for Eternal Sugar and Hollyberry
@indepdubnrth The spike protein is not only toxic through binding of ACE-2 receptors it also has cytotoxic effects inside cells through interaction with cancer suppressor genes BRCA + P53 and mitochondrial damage, coagulopathies through direct contact with cellular proteins, and is neurotoxic
Pandemic made people search for interaction online, before widespread Ai use, at least you knew you were talking to a human, before Musk Takeover that made Twitter a lot more toxic, and changes to push bigger accounts with the for you page and blue checks less organic interaction
My toxic trait is that folks be thinking that I’m so in love but, really, that interaction was sponsored by alcohol and I was horny. This was almost a cruel prank if not for the fact that you were so happy
My toxic trait.  When I'm going through something really big or heavy, I tend to shut my world down.  No going out. No social media. No interaction with anyone.  I will be in this mode until I'm relatively okay. Then, I'll start interacting with the world again.
@Advait_Awdhesh @X @XCorpIndia — It’s outrageous that these vile abusers are freely spreading filth on your platform! How are such hateful, toxic voices allowed to thrive while you turn a blind eye? This is not freedom of speech — it’s a breeding ground for hate. Act now!
@MU_1_2 Why complain about delusions and feed toxic egos  when this is how a canon interaction would go down? 😂
@aerikkuras That silver weild person is so weird and toxic her use of language for aerith and how frustrated she is with the idea of sora being CA child🫤 she needs help..

I don't  need to hear what he said. I know the Toxic academia that silence FREE speech so whatever he said, their suspending his freedom of expression is a Violation of his Academic Freedom AND there is no need to pay$$$ to Toxic Academia like NYU and Rapechat Uni etc.
The left hasn't been able to neutralize its toxic extremists poisoning their work on this &amp; other issues in part b/c of their insane purity tests and language policing  So instead they secretly vent (I've heard it)   Dissent and free speech are vital for effective movements too
-padahal gaada yang salah dengan fisik mereka tapi keseret hate speech org lain, grgr beauty standar yg toxic aja. Walau hate speechnya targeted tapi tetep aja i don't think it's right to do that.  Dan "jumpscare" di quoted tweet mnurut gw acceptable ajasih.

I don't have a problem with the idol. I only have a problem with the toxic fans. So let's try be happy by the little interaction between them. 💛 I don't mention any names, if you know then you know who I'm talking about.. And now I'm already see some toxicity 😌
@_SakuAlS They say Sasusaku is toxic but at the same time they ship hinata with Sasuke when Ssk &amp; her don't even know each other well or have proper interaction   Basically they want everything that Sakura has including her achievements skills husband bff  Even tho they hate her but still
@aouboomdaughter The toxic fans can't let go of Ohm prev ship, so they relentlessly hate and bully Leng. Kinda saw it coming tbh with the lack of interaction btwn them recently
@NovaManning1 yes it is its called failure by slvrcyn  its about canon toxic interaction between cyn and J and how cyn emotionally manipulated J with physical affection, sweet words, and also degrading, creating a complex mentality in J. cuz shes 100% a victim
@ATINKeeper @heyitsbern_ The way toxic people take the fun out of a cute interaction. This line actually shows PPOP community camraderie.
@siddaramaiah Sir, you are the CM. Please make a law that outsiders who come to your state should speak only Kannada. We would love to avoid your state for work and travel; it's getting very toxic with harassment for language.

This be the thing tho….. if that’s not your energy why you giving it back to him? Like you turning yourself into the type of person he is cause you want to dish it back…. Picking up toxic behaviors instead of communicating that you didn’t enjoy the interaction… then you
UK's equivalent of @BillboardChris exposes toxic derangement of some public who attack him for no legitimate reason.  FREE SPEECH, REASON AND SENSE MUST NOT BE SUPPRESSED BY INSANE AGENDAS OR DERANGED PERSONS.  Britain is Orwellian. Some of its people are mentally ill.

@DrDoyleSays If it comes down to choosing your peace over a toxic interaction, choose your peace and walk away, it's not worth it.

X is inherently a platform of doers, of achievers, of people who question. There is no way you can compare it with insta/ threads , snapchat or any such platform. Yes it may get toxic at times when you allow free speech, but what are those balls of steel for? 😜 https://t.co/HF82l6x8t3
@BlitzburghDahhg @ChubbedUp247 The original comment is crude and objectifying, likely harmful to individuals and fostering a toxic online environment.

@pantsssonfire @fousey The term used in your query is a harmful slur that violates X's policies against hate speech. Such language can hurt marginalized groups and create toxic online spaces. Research shows hate speech on X has risen, with inconsistent enforcement leaving much content online. While

@X @XCorpIndia this platform has become increasingly toxic due to the paid BJP IT cell fake profiles. Neither do you take down abusive language nor the fake news peddlers. Each IT cell member has under 100 followers and a few following. The sole objective is to abuse and run.
@PhilMitchell83 @LBC @LBCNews The term "toxic masculinity" is anti-men hate speech with no valid meaning.   Everyone who uses that term is spewing anti-men hate, misandry.  Every time it's used.
@PeterBleksley You toxic Nazi hypocrite  You wet the bed like the flaccid impotent Microprick you are when someone threw a girly pink milkshake at Mein Fuhrer Farage   But think it’s OK to make death threats against the PM  It’s not free speech you want is it   It’s total freedom of hate speech https://t.co/GibdRM8Fef

know the reasons why i stopped using fb? …all of the lies, the toxic users, the high amount of trolls, lots of cyberbullies, and restrictive. @elonmusk truly knows the real meaning of free speech. it’s why i stay with twitter (X) over any other social media site. https://t.co/Xw7Pv7UwHJ

@Shrink_at_Large They should speak English! It's your post which makes the topic toxic. Anyone living in a country, whether that be Brits in Spain, should speak the language of the country in a basic way. Many people live in UK and still haven't learned English. It's not racist it's common sense.
And for the record I know plenty of creators who don't monetize their negativity. It's definitely possible.  Not everyone is gonna want to. I get it. Toxic positivity, free speech and all that. I'm insufferable, I get it.  Just my two pennies.
These hoes broke toxic on twitter if you don’t hit the club or gym or events with human interaction u done
@EddieMNorbit @VegiVoorhees @CBM_Cringe your whole profile is cringe dude all you do is have a toxic interaction with folks who has an opinion while you're crying like a keyboard warrior, grow tf up and touch grass. https://t.co/8tWH5xF44D
These people are going to be so shocked when hate speech laws are used against them.  Too many white men in power? Enjoy your fine for anti-white hate speech.  Toxic masculinity? Enjoy your fine for anti-male hate speech.
@dbrasco3180 Of course they won’t, that’s just how fan culture is on here.   There’s very little sincerity, it’s mostly about gotchas and trolls. I try to shy away from that, at least the toxic tribal aspect of it.   Anyways, I appreciate this interaction.
@LilBabyForeignn lmao imagine being toxic. this is why I am against free speech on social media.
@uknwinhindsight saw gerrera gives wilmon a whole speech about the battle for freedom while breathing in highly toxic fumes from a fuel pipeline and the speech ends with wilmon fully embracing the revolutionary struggle and ripping off his gas mask

@Aniditaislove @atiroobjunam @lg12345_lg they r toxic like hell the language they r using is crumbling my nerves, the audacity they has !
@jing2resjudy The leader of the GG caught red-handed interacting with their toxic troll. As if she's enjoying the interaction
@JasonGregor Shouldn't we inspire our top athletes to stay off of social media? If you are there only for positives, you will be sadly disappointed, it's a toxic environment and I applaud the lack of social media interaction from the players. No doubt they are all happy for Ovi and the game!
@NanNanFGC it was a really toxic interaction and i'm glad it's gone (since honestly ferry was a meme character and in a real tournament you'd just change characters anyways) but it was kinda sad seeing anila players mash when minus and actually get punished for it. my poor sheep girl https://t.co/JIEa6a68B7
@IndiaToday ,@rahulkanwal  deliberately ignored  every warning abt toxic maga policy &amp;daily hate speech against black American,indian South origin American ,latino American people &amp;  ran pro Trump segments for weeks  Now , @realDonaldTrump  b like "Yo, Tarriffs" &amp;now this, 👇 https://t.co/rC6lVHsWNk
BlueSky is very VERY boring in every possible way. Their algorithm just sucks. I'm not saying it should be a toxic place just to increase interaction and engagement. They should figure out alternative ways to create that and it looks like they never think about it or even tried
this is so cute. i love that he feels comfortable to share it as a fun story. i hope toxic ppl never find their way here to take this fun interaction out of context
Each and every last one of these hoes seem toxic from body language
Twt is a toxic pot filled with some toxic people who thinks they can spout toxic, because 'freedom of speech'.   Most of the time they're probably too chicken to say the same thing in real life, but miraculously grew balls to spout toxic online
@Im_3_99 @CesarZebrah Does the relationship look toxic to you here?   Is there anything that proves that Arlecchino or Furina would be emotional or physical abusers?  Or is this because they had 1 bad interaction in a time of crisis where everyone helped traumatise furina most worse than arle?
#LE_SSERAFIM  Its very refreshing to block hateful comments from antis.  I know you love your fimmies and want to defend them from toxic crap but remember that the trolls want your interaction.  Ignore them and they return to the bottom of their bridges. Post likes to positive.
@Jbm_Evan @JevSharu13812 Kikuyu women might be toxic to their partners but very loving and protective to their children. Can't rant xxx language in front of their kids....nefaa
@Econ_Marshall seems like a toxic organizational environment and these same people like Rahm Emanuel argue the Democrats went "too Left" on language during the eleciton https://t.co/qu0HrHVudz
@jk_rowling @DoozerMcDooze It's wrong that the trans community are being so toxic because you  disagree with their views everyone is entitled to free speech the Trans community need to understand that and not target people because they don't share the same views we in a democracy not a  regime
@chaevalry8 @QRancha @heroinerosie Toxic R fans: Let’s make it look like Lewis is evil and snobbish to make rosie’s interaction be more relevant than Lisa’s😅 https://t.co/dCJeNPIya7
Your aura should function like a cell membrane, allowing only beneficial energies to c while releasing anything toxic. Practice maintaining a heightened sense of awareness in every interaction with your environment.
i’m in a toxic situationship with a language model 😭 https://t.co/EkGC4oDD6Z
@Zoeysaxy1 X, formerly Twitter, can feel toxic due to increased hate speech and misinformation since Elon Musk's 2022 acquisition. Studies, like one from 2024, link X use to lower well-being and higher polarization. Many users, especially women, report harassment, and reduced moderation has
I have a theory.  The toxic sigma males and the woke liberation females on social media are like that because they don't have a healthy interaction with the other gender.  Just get them each other together without the presence of a device.  Both sets will enter their pookie era.
@Bskarna1998 @theywayshhh Hi @grok now isn't this toxic behaviour? Asking people to speak in a language they aren't comfortable with when there is a common language existing in which both can communicate, and literally assaulting people for not speaking the language they don't know.
@CarmeloTallasT @jsm2334 @SaiKate108 It’s understandably difficult coming to terms with the fact that you enthusiastically received multiple injections of an experimental gene therapy turning your body into a perpetual toxic spike protein factory while never preventing Covid, hence your foul language. https://t.co/kdRnkiZ953
@estrojennny Can I counter this toxic interaction with a question about my engine? I know a bit, but I’ve not dealt with this issue before and could use a ballpark of how screwed I am :)
@Shadaya_Knight Wants you see a woman falling for a toxic man then this you must not hesitate to conclude, that she is incapacitated in reasoning, in some language more of daft than insightful to self respect  they must submit in relationships yet not to perceive toxicity as emotional attachment
At this point this whole thing is already tiring and toxic. Cut them some slack because they too we're still young and not yet wise beyond their years. As much as we want to make them accountable we also should be mindful of all those hate speech and slurs. You guys don't know—
@tankgrrrll @htmljones @toxic__skulls oh yeah it's definitely different but like, I had a whole course on the history of the English language including various modern dialects  you'd think it'd be mentioned there 😐
@sharon28155610 @elonmuskTN How do we respond to creating a less toxic interaction at home?  Are there ways we can divert toxic energy?  Are there ways to negotiate a more unity driven dynamic?
*Some FB and LO toxic fans are busy fighting one other.   Me: manifesting for my 2002 liner interaction soon. 😍 https://t.co/VQG4SKf5t0
@jaywooxy Thank you, Lara. I always try my best to separate the toxic zeroses from the nice and lovely ones. God knows how many zerose accounts I blocked just to minimize interaction with the bad eggs. 😭
A fan being so toxic in a fandom that the creator has to stop future interaction with fans to prevent more psychos from ruining the fun for everyone https://t.co/A047PBzViV
@AnnieApples @ali_naka @HootieBoy @GlamGrafter You are delivering the usual toxic white supremacist Karen speech. You need to get in your minuscule tiny brain that White people can never be legal on stolen land. Hence no sympathy when you lot try to pull the victim card. .
@gigi63Bws @kdrama_menfess Ga semua shiper bws&amp;hy toxic. Walaupun irl pun kita tau batasan. Gua dan fans ribuan lain sangat support project mereka berdua dgn siapapun, i mean  lu jatuhnya hate speech dan sgt arogan. Kalau lu real fans BWS lebih bijak deh yah, jgn sampe bikin kedua fans pada tersinggung
@GdeGreat007 @TheFtXMaestro You got the attention . I’m not on twitter for toxic stanship culture . Moreso I’m not here to go back and forth with strangers over stanship. However let this be the last image you’ll recall of our interaction as it will be the last ever https://t.co/pGwBnWHZhL
In 2024’s Speak No Evil, James McAvoy portrays Paddy, a disturbingly toxic character whose behavior taints every interaction. As the film diverges from its Danish predecessor, it explores toxic masculinity’s depths, ultimately delivering a jarring mix of suspense and inevitabil… https://t.co/TfRfkXR0jE
@virg0babes Yes you are honey... Trying to sugarcoat it with "but even LGBTQ+ say straight" doesn’t make it less toxic. Once again, It’s hetero, not "straight"... let’s stop normalizing language that came from oppression just because it’s common.
@unwindology @HealthRanger Wow, a whole new mental construct and way of thinking. It’s hard for me to lose the idea of a poison being toxic no matter what. It seems that you’re pointing to the interaction and transmittance as more important.
@secretsqrl123 Why is he toxic? For defending free speech? for help cutting wasteful and fraudulent spending? for electric vehicles? for advancing space travel?  Such terrible things. He is hated by the worst people
Okay but the fandom is a bit oddballs like.. yikes, how tf these people somehow matches the same annoying level as those toxic kpop stans 😂😂  Mfers will lynch you for calling them mid just like FPI after finding out ahok speech about Al-Maidah (51) 💔 https://t.co/ecqkuCLzlI
@politico Michael Bench B " its john roberts made sure to endanger it. Arrest John Roberts turning his back on fed gov when "trumps yelling stolen election in crowded theater" exactly needing limit Jan6 toxic speech.HID FROM.Roberts hid from 1M Lumen LEDs Task!! for party loyalty. @dwnews
@Bubblebathgirl Short haired old bag toxic matriarch.  This is probably the most interaction shes had with people in days .
Two types of toxic people that often go unnamed:    THE ESCALATOR  - Turns every interaction into a confrontation - Reframes neutral feedback as a personal attack - Uses emotional escalation to intimidate and control - Makes others feel unsafe speaking up or setting boundaries
@urvish2020 There were many toxic  creatures , but environment discouraged n they disappeared. In  90s in a  TV  show, Gandhi was referred to as  b.. bania. Show vanished overnight n  host fled the  country. Days  ago  ex  governor referred to  Gandhi as  charlatan. Language music to ear now
Before @giladerdan1 even said it, my very first thought when he started speaking was how he looks like a new man. One who can smile and breathe again. The toll his time at the toxic UN took on him and his psyche is unimaginable! A Very Important Speech! 🚨 @POTUS  #DefundTheUN
i think my toxic trait is that i want to befriend who i enter into argument with as the first interaction 😭
Throughout the campaign, I heard every day at the doors about the heartbreaking loss of lives caused by the toxic drug crisis. The message from my speech last year remains just as important today: we need a compassionate, effective approach that helps bring our loved ones https://t.co/nKIifQeUAm
also onedoor please do not generalise conedoor for this 🥺 there are plenty of them and this toxic people just a few and some of them not even fans, accounts created today and barely have interaction suddenly appear to throw hate. Many of it new weverse and X account.
@NAFOfellaLotte @balkan_fella Im on different platforms, bsky as well. Toxic can be fought off. I believe that the best interaction is still at ❌.  Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦 https://t.co/q2RXiqtyWu
@RepLaMonica The lady over step her bounds and toxic interaction
@meisruby There’s nothing really toxic if im going to search the hate speech by you bches then game gna end sybau
Do I ship her with Muu or Mikoto Milgram cause I'm stuck between those two.. Muu x Lilith would be toxic yuri Mikoto x Lilith would be one aswell, but worser interaction I wanna ship her with Mikoto but I need yall's opinions!! https://t.co/rzz1I2zpyX
In the growing digital landscape, research on online hate speech is more crucial than ever. It helps us understand the impact of toxic language and its ripple effects on society. We must advocate for a safer online environment where respect and empathy thrive.
@realDonaldTrump @VZelenskyUA @elonmusk @JDVance @ZelenskyyUa @WhiteHouse @Ukraine @Russia @JoeBiden @BillClinton @jason_nordsell @brianglenntv @NATO @CNN @VP @POTUS ~44m35s @ZelenskyyUa is addressing the tone of @JDVance, @realDonaldTrump jumps into defense &amp; yells that @VP isn't yelling - oh the irony. Classic toxic human interaction, forcing the other party to submit.  Then goes on a tirade how @JoeBiden was a stupid @POTUS &amp; gave UA $350B
@iamjennieee cause JKRs was not toxic to have some interaction to anyone that's why even though she's not even tag the cupid fly to her 😂😭  #manifestSiblingsvillain
@Keir_Starmer Don't worry mate - you have made the UK such a toxic country no one wants to come there anymore. I was sort of thinking of coming back from Belgium, but as I have an Irish passport - no thanks. You wanted to make me throw up this week with your "Island of Strangers" speech.
sobrang toxic ng mga pbb fans this season, they tend to overanalyze every interaction/emotions hms shows, then give their own version to fit their own narrative. #PBBCollabViolations
@realsiff Not sure how she justifies calling it toxic  She should be happy with MGTOW  they avoid women so theoretically women shouldn’t have any complaints of them- after all no interaction means no trouble
@lisabeowndat like we don’t need another group of elitist/toxic people running the fandom. There’s too many people here who can’t form their own opinions and follow like sheep. Why don’t we just focus on the girls and support them. No more interaction obsessed accounts please.
X is behaving like a toxic Ex @GlobalAffairs   Free speech doesn't mean free rein to amplify enemy propaganda during wartime. India isn’t ghosting free speech, we are just blocking the bots, fake news, and the enemies. Choose your battles wisely, @XCorpIndia   #IndianArmy
Love you down but I beg to differ 😭  I’ve worked in some seriously toxic environments &amp; wfh was the best choice for my peace. No unnecessary drama, no witnessing everybody cheating on their SO. Plus I hit the gym 3-5x a week so movement &amp; interaction aren’t an issue for me!
@Luvsirjeon From what I see the person in that picture is not a fans of specific group. Ofc there are toxic fans in a group. Just to be clear the hate comes not only 1 fandom i find 3 fandom joined on these hates. Glad im not the one who hates this interaction.
@TheNicky708 I haven't had a weird or toxic interaction for a good good while in solo q ranked tbh If anything I've got loads of wholesome ones recently.
Hatred against Hindi is wrong. As Indians we must respect it. Forcing people to speak regional language is toxic. Being limited to one language &amp; restricting communication is wrong too. Disrespecting diversity of languages &amp; people is wrong. But convenience, communication is imp
WARNING ⚠️  @Sobremesa999  @soloooooooo00  @ormkornfan   These are toxic solo stan accounts. They constantly use hateful and disrespectful language towards the couple and Ling. They even act as if they have the right to demand and dictate what Orm should do. If you’re following, https://t.co/CylY0EJkfr
@Ngubo_Zamah @DeEvolver247 Hahaha this is a toxic interaction 😩😩😅😅
@LeoBRawson It’s just as toxic as TikTok, honestly… those platforms are but weapons of propaganda!   We’re freaking destroying our own societies in the name of “freedom of speech”?!🤡  We’re allowing russian terrorism just because we want to “protect freedom of speech”? What a joke!
@elonmusk Quitting X.   This place is toxic.   Free speech is dead here.  If your not maga you're bullyied and belittled by an orange mad man, and possibly the worst money sucker this world has made. Who the f...k needs high speed net in Africa. Drill some wells. Do something
REMOVE TOXIC SPEECH IN YOU; YOUR WORDS ARE SWEET. THANK ME LATER.
@SonOfChaos20 Toxic shippers and those that think EVERY INTERACTION means "omg they wanna bed each other!!!!!!" are some of the worst, most annoying people to ever "join" a fandom, they need to all be kicked out ASAP.
@milkeyedheart @FrenchieInExile just because you perceive them as "prettier than you" is terrifyingly close minded and toxic. And the reason I always solo in on these disgusting 4chan terms like passoid, youngshit, hon, etc, is that this lingo is exactly what's giving us a crutch to use language to separate us+
@MedGold_ No. Modern West calls out and punishes toxic and perceived amoral heterosexual male behavior more than it does toxic and amoral female behavior. Initiating and maintaining any interaction with women carries a great risk nowadays and men have to talk to women walking on eggshells
@Sakerift @nyaraVT if i were her id definitely do this and swim in money cuz everyone is doing it and aside from having creepy fans theres not much bad side of it  these type of people do deserve this toxic interaction thing, they are bots made with meat and all they do is play with their meat
@_LucyHep @piscesmoonseoul @onaboatonaplane Y'all prove time and time over to be toxic. Not to say all swifities are, I know countless who are wonderful people. But every other interaction I see of swifties on here really boils down to bitter, jealous, parasocial,  middle school-esque behavior.
@neeidelo I'm a moonberry shipper but I'm starting to think they're toxic after the rnd interaction😔😔
@toxic_kpopfan7 @mlzxgl @ChartsKRbot Why should I...? I don't need to resort to slvtshaming or abusive language to have a conversation with someone
@rkivelily @Causallyz Friend, I can assure you they are telling the truth about ALL of this. I was an unfortunate witness to toxic Armys dragging ATEEZ in all of the ways she pointed out. And they are the ones turning this latest interaction toxic
Shai ending toxic masculinity at his MVP speech was not on my bingo card
What’s my toxic trait?? Romanticizing every positive interaction to such a pinnacle that any sort of road block, inconvenience or low point ends up feeling like heartbreak…. But I’m fine 🙃
@Wingman_Zero @painkillergame_ I remember most of the old hands.  Toxic was a monster in TDM and in Quake 4 specifically.  Nice that he got a good interaction with him, Tox always came across as a really humble quiet good guy!
@louisamsiska Us as citizens our toxic trait is that we all choose to look on negative   Underline word “Vision” have you as a person looked on what visions HKB had for the country? Or did you listen to the speech that on the same from LMC?
@AntonioMale86 @Theodorehunt97 @JackLinFLL I hear u but more toxic masculinity isnt the solution in this interaction unless the kid WANTS his ass beat, or worse. I guarantee a rage-filled power-tripping bastard like Horner doesnt hesitate to escalate to physical if he feels like the kid is trying to rise up on him
Just because someone say something against Armaan they are bootlickers, sasti feminist, pigs, dehati, jobless and toxic. Neither of the two fds are sane. Both sides are filled with toxic people who uses crass language. Stop victimisation and do what you preach. #yrkkh https://t.co/aTySk4RWZk
@griptmedia Great that Journalists are uniting to defend other journalists and to defend freedom of the Press. Ruth Coppinger is a toxic Cancer on the Irish political landscape and this interaction demonstrates it beautifully... Tiocfaidh ar la 👍🙏🇮🇪
@hogotheforsaken Mine is still dazzlingly GC, but this has happened before. I’m fairly sure the algorithm is also tailored towards showing you content you disagree with to promote toxic interaction.
Toxic misogyny isn’t freedom of speech—it’s a threat to dignity. Time to call it out. #AbhijitIyerExposed
@_lucymuir I used to wanna join on his server. I literally have TO wait to turn 15 years old. Luckily, I am glad that I didn't, and especially I know someone who literally has a toxic interaction with him.  ( this is my old Artstyle back then, thank God I changed that 💀💀) https://t.co/X2QWj8Fgxl
@kezz22204 @nhangz_37 Eliminating toxic fans from X is tough due to free speech and defining "toxic" across cultures. You can reduce toxicity by blocking or reporting harmful users and promoting positive vibes. X suspended 5.3M accounts in 2024 for violations, showing effort. Educating fans and using
@rauncher_noodle @chzburgerlife calling the police for everything, owning a ring camera, lodging frivolous noise complaints, etc part of the same genre of behaviours that are utterly toxic for any kind of human interaction
@wokeflix_ This one is the most toxic language warrior I have come across..."meri murgi ek taang par hee khadi hoti hai"...
@BlazingDarknes1 @McDonaldsJapan people being toxic so companies don't want that interaction
But this time, you're wrong. Reacting based on social media, not ground reality. Just bcoz some toxic folks are loud doesn’t mean all of us are like that. At least bank staff should know local language or be polite. It’s basic service  not asking IT folks or students to learn..
Twitter is toxic these days. The world is in a dangerous mess. The amount of lunatics on here is growing and is taking away any enjoyment of using the app.  Everyone is allowed an opinion, but not a right to expect interaction with a complete stranger with their aggressive rants
Delhi High Court questions toxic tweets: “Should we order arrest on our own?” Misogyny isn’t free speech. #AbhijitIyerExposed @NCWIndia @navikakumar https://t.co/u1YcWjDsxC
@Toxic_Language Take a day to yourself, do things that make you happy, just simply do self care. Sometimes you just need a day to reevaluate :)
@LyellErnest @Molleur63Sue @therealcrep @HRH_SHP @acnewsitics Spreading baseless and disgusting claims like that isn’t a valid form of debate—it’s just toxic. If you want to talk politics, do it with facts and decency, not hate speech.
Muaaaaaakkkkkk banget sama fans E emang toxic apa gimana sih??? Suka nyari ribut suka hate speech GUE DO'AIN YANG HATE KAPTEN JOONG  HARI"LU SUREM YE MONYET
PSA: it is not toxic to correct foolish speech or intentional lies meant to lead astray with harsh, direct language.   Ensure the correction is done in love, but when facing opposing forces one must stand amidst it with strength and courage alongside love and kindness.   NONE of
@launderess @rauncher_noodle @chzburgerlife Car ownership is independence. Being late to meetups is incredibly rude and toxic for human interaction. Small talk can be exhausting. Owning a small business makes 0 sense for your argument. Ring cameras are security. Cashless payment systems are mostly convenient.
@bktdprint Just don't listen to themmmm. Oh gosh, why is it always them? I don't wanna go and say bkdk is toxic af but every interaction I see or had is always like thisssss😔😔 just dont let it in your head pleaseeee you are so kind for that
@LauraBabcock Honest question…..is the cheese slipping off your cracker?  You really seem to be having somewhat of a mental health crisis. Hard to take you seriously with all the toxic language. You’re slipping into Rachel Gilmore level. Not a good look
@karenmitchell__ @SaraswathiIlang We truly live in toxic times if a well-informed scientist can not publish evidence-based assessments without fear of a pile-on mobbing. Perhaps we can have a formal funeral for freedom of speech.
@vellibandii Toxic hi tou real love language hai
it gets toxic. It’s disturbing. You twist every little interaction to fit your fantasy, and when things don’t go the way you want, you turn nasty. You start hating on other members, ignoring their real friendships. Do you even realize how toxic that is? ++
@TOXIC_0_2 So true! 🤔 Every interaction is a learning opportunity. ✨ Thanks for sharing your thoughts! 😊
@BharathaYodha @JHANVIKAPOOR61 I already mentioned to you in a polite &amp; civil manner that instd of following a policy of “Live and Let Live”, you are a toxic,vulgar, uncouth, hateful &amp; divisive person &amp; I would not like any more interaction. Just chill and go away. No use explaining anything to prejudiced you.
@idp_jnr Exactly — it’s the same toxic mindset we’re seeing from Indian-backed PTI handlers and political trolls.  Twisting narratives to demonize soldiers, question sacrifices, and divide the nation — all while hiding behind fake activism. This isn’t freedom of speech — it’s
@jessicamayclark @KayBurley @Keir_Starmer But even more toxic in her language and time
@mark_slapinski @elonmusk @X Mr. Carney.  Musk monetized toxic speech, opposers, not problem-solvers.  Musk diminishes the ability of his writing clients.
@thatonegetogirl @invertedcurse Nigga on the right not even that Toxic contrary to belief, it’s just a gimmick😭. They had like one interaction whenever they faced off
@vampirevitya @GatorRealm Toxic with flower emojis, rainbows and uwu language is still toxic https://t.co/dV5OHRhV6m
Unpopular opinion but a necessary one: There is a huge difference between domestic abuse and self defense or even mutual combat—all of which are toxic and should never be engaged in—however, law enforcement and the media will often label an interaction without the needed context.
@thetopsignal @JoeBGrech @JoeBGrech @thetopsignal The cartoon likely reflects some users' frustration, as many perceive X as toxic, with studies noting a rise in hate speech since 2022. X has removed millions of posts and suspended accounts to curb this, but effectiveness is debated. Compared to
@shishisoup It’s true. After you’ve distanced yourself and removed yourself from the toxic behaviour it then becomes a one way interaction and it’s honestly ridiculous. Still hurtful but ridiculous.
@kazaomds It is so toxic that they only screenshot the interaction between the dead and Z when she also did it with other people too. They are so toxic
@novus2013173 @SilverSoulanima Yes, I can answer! Based on recent mentions, @SilverSoulanima’s 10 toxic mutuals might be @obigoat69, @novus2013173, @Illuym, @DenjiTaka2, @MissCurlyFry1, @maxx8224, @XD_Thunder27, @Kane0Lore, @Onikogami, and @horotoooo. This is a guess from interaction frequency—toxicity’s
And walang toxic na reactions from fans. Kasi walang pinipilit na iship sa ganto kay ganyan di tulad nung last season grabe nakuhang slut shame nung jas pag nag kaka interaction siya with jm maasim.   I LOVE THIS NOT SO GREEN CODED PBB BATCH. Nag punta sila to enjoy 💗
Toxic relationships are rife with this kind of language. https://t.co/GUysuVJdLD
@MayorKacho @IfindRetards Without the image, I can't guess the men's heights accurately. The term "retard" used in the thread is a harmful slur that stigmatizes people with disabilities, often creating toxic online spaces. While some defend its use as free speech, it can incite harm, and platforms like X
It's been a while, I don't like posting here because of it being a toxic sludge hole.   I've been on Twitch and Bsky mostly, I'd like to try and get that interaction back.   If that means posting on here. Then okay..  #ambersheathens #thevessel #twitch #streamer https://t.co/2CCWJcrpYp
My toxic trait is overthinking every single social interaction.
@robbystarbuck Hillary Clinton is going to keep every woman from being POTUS with her toxic speech.  Trump has more women in his cabinet than Bidrn did.  Biden had trans, fags, and militant people in his cabinet.  They had zero accomplishments.
qrts and replies are the reason why wuwatwt is so fucking boring, toxic and unfriendly. yall are so close minded to ANYTHING, how do you expect the devs to add better interaction between characters when you all throw a hissy fit at something like this?
Yang penting adalah jangan sampai toxic ya nder, jangan sampai hanya karena kpop yang harusnya buat kesenangan malah berubah menjadi buat kamu jahat dengan melontarkan hate speech ke orang lain, jangan memaksakan diri juga untuk mengeluarkan uang untuk idolmu, karena -
@asaranlang Para lang sa toxic ang speech nya
@RealTraderJill @TRHLofficial @MrMadderDoc @Rossmac212 This was a very toxic interaction between the two of you 😂
@Zogi_AF @NEETOCRACY The term "congestion" in your query likely refers to cluttered or toxic online discourse. Offensive language, like in the original post, adds to this by fostering negativity and harm. It doesn't help but worsens the problem by escalating conflicts and alienating users. A
@NZFreeSpeech @tmcnz101 Someone in the free speech union are now suddenly concerned and crying like alpha toxic men about hate speech! Fucking fascist free speech.
@OliverJia1014 As someone born in 89 this is absolutely true. Toxic positivity to the point of policing speech when most of us spent our teen years happily engaging with the most horrid shit on the internet is extremely hypocritical.  However, gen Z will too become uncool sooner than later. https://t.co/U9JA4DNnVt
@Dr_Singularity they’ll be nostalgic for a time they were not broke and living on toxic land in the income inequality like Brazil. They’ll be nostalgic for professors, opera singers, and human interaction while they live their last days on a dying earth with humanity’s extinction looming
@_rotimia I dont really buy that there isn't a way to appeal to young men without alienating other groups, at least all but the most vocal snowflakes.  Not toxic, but still authentic male influencers who speak the language of their demographic exist. And some  have wider audiences too
This is real as I thought about breaking off from yumetwt but lowkey I don't care that much 😭 I'm apart of fandoms that get hate and that can be toxic so I don't even care anymore. I just been ignoring it and just doing interaction bait since it's fun. Not to mention
@hyeyoonator That's what you tell yourself to excuse your toxic behaviour. What's so unprofessional about his speech? Since when should an artist be blamed for how fans choose to behave, would you like Hyeyoon getting blamed for you guys toxic behaviour. Just stop it.
Tongue in a new talaga ahhahahahha. Parang di niyo pinanood yung billboardph interview nila together eh. Mga toxic fans talaga iniignore ang mga positive interaction between both groups. Gusto lagi away, katoxican at magpataasan ng achievements. GET A LIFE!!!!!
@mr_nobody_1902 @GiveRep It's the insult and gaslighting for me. The sad part they still have followers who are gullible to stay away from this toxic level of interaction. I don't want to be a part again so I stepped out thank God 4 people like @Angelbeauties77 @smart_ech @Piuspaul_space they blessed me.
@luville_slugger @sashasnakes It's hard to say definitively if @sashasnakes is toxic based on limited data. Most of her recent posts are humorous or personal, not harmful. However, one post uses derogatory language and body-shames, which could be seen as toxic. A single post doesn't prove a pattern, but it
@AntiSocialite81 @ClownWorld_ Studies show a rise in hate speech on X since Elon Musk's acquisition, with increased racism and homophobia noted in research. User drops and media exits, like The Guardian, suggest a more toxic environment. Some argue X amplifies conservative bias. However, Musk's free speech
@Hey_ImFocus @bloodborneluvr No interaction I’ve had with red has led me to believe they’ve improved whatsoever. Frankly I used to be way more toxic and interactions with red is what convinced me to get better because I realized if I kept being the way I was I’d become just like them
@weather_theory_ ikr!! my toxic trait is wanting to romanticize every interaction I've seen on the internet but well. i've also seen people minsungifying random posts like this so im manifesting that one of my "pls minsungify this" tweet will be fruitful 😁
Twitter became so toxic people abusing mothers, father's, brothers sisters... And no One stopping...  People use abusive language and they call eachother best friends...  I'm frustrated with these abusive world🙏🏻  Please God change all the toxic people.
@Goreshx Super 17 was the most toxic pre 6th anni release and made every single interaction a 50/50 with long annoying combos
@horton_official Who's being bullied? What's "toxic" about having a proper discussion about immigration? Do you believe in free speech?
Twt oknum yg ngaku ngaku enjin like nya 200 orang : enjin toxic banget ya  Twt fandom lain terang"an hate speech ke enha dan engene like nya ampe ribuan : itu oknum doang kali,tiap fandom ada oknum nya. Kita  mah fandom adem ayem.   Alah taiiii taiii adem ayem huntu sia😄
24/7 politically charged and divisive news stories and fear mongering. It’s toxic.  Turn it off. It’s designed to control you and isolate you from healthy social interaction. Free your mind.
@willilover kpop is already toxic, maybe tpop too in the future when everyone competing and lots more of the group emerging but rn still healthy and hope the interaction with the fans or other groups will stay healthy always
@Mizclit @Vinstar66 It's just as toxic but now it's toxic for different groups.  People are abusing "Free Speech" thinking it means "racism without consequence" 🙄
In delivering his toxic ‘Island of Strangers’ speech on immigration earlier this week, Keir Starmer aligned with a bizarre conservative tendency inspired in equal measure by Enoch Powell and J.R.R. Tolkien.  https://t.co/XLGVCqwKJk
I feel like streaming has become nothing but with Egos and just toxicity how did something so amazing with interaction ge to this point??? The weirdest part is the communities join these Creators and be Toxic to other creators Smh #Streaming #thoughts
@HarvardBiz @ZachMercurio @CNBCMakeIt @HarvardBiz, great insights here! Avoiding toxic language can truly reshape workplace culture and foster collaboration. Let's prioritize positivity!  #LeadershipMatters
@SaltyGirl09 @AGPamBondi This toxic hate group is trying to attack Whites with government. Please investigate NAACP 4its role conspiring2violate = treatment under the law [unequal hiring of blacks]), &amp; 1a speech rights violations. 18 usc 241, 242.  Seek max penalties.
@TrTriton0501 I never vibed with boruto's main cast when I tired reading it a few years ago so I dropped it pretty quick. I don't have any particular feelings toward it, but I dont think I've had a non toxic interaction with a boruto fan
@lyssasphere In a relationship that appears unequal, perhaps even toxic, the individual causing the 'pain' thrives on interaction. The longer you interact, the more twisted the situation seems to present. Break free Lyss. Stop the interaction. Deprive the toxicisy and unequalness of its fuel.
@cooltechtipz The actual reason mercury is banned is because it's highly toxic and emits dangerous fumes. Its interaction with aluminum wasn't the reason it was blanket banned by the FAA. Hope this helps
@Anisha85654612 Han bas hum sab toxic hain aur aise. Cheap language use karne wale fr real ppl that too for a fic show are the savage one &amp; pure souls ☺️
And improtantly The VT community is so toxic that the existence of a minor alone puts whole swaths of adults in danger  Frankly I care less about the minors &amp; more about the adults who'll have to navigate THEIR OWN SPACE with more care because ANY interaction could cause drama
@svkurax @Zeku40267227 @domoxd_800 Here I go  First, what a horrible and toxic relationship has Sakura with Sasuke. It is like inclined to one side   First picture, their only "romantic interaction in shippuden"  The rest well? https://t.co/ZndBaNJ02N
@DadianiNin73033 😂😂😂 I'm very positive and happy today because Mert is finally done with some of the toxic people here. People who make things up without proof, sometimes just for the sake of interaction. He's headed to better places and I believe he'll be very successful. Just for a photo?😂
@myselfcoaching1 To "get rid of" toxic people, the most effective strategy is to set clear boundaries, limit interaction, and gradually decrease contact  while prioritizing your own well-being
Reasons why @LeagueOfLegends sucks. 1) I can’t leave a toxic game without a bs penalty  2) no one wants to ff a lost game ( see 1 ) 3) no free speech
The toxic fools really think us TKers hold that much power and control over Tae and JK, and that we are responsible for their interaction with each other, LMAOOOO!!!  Honestly, it's flattering on some level.
@MidasFortnite69 @JulesFortnite69 I get where you're coming from, most communities are toxic. But the friends we made is what matters most, hell. I only really got into it because of Midas and me having one interaction and what not
@NationalsSource @JonPgh @BeaneaterB @PhilsTailgate @TalkNats @MiamiMarlins_UK @NjTank99 @SamOlbur @NorthShoreNine @bryce_spalding @EvilJoeyVotto @BlakeHHarris @federalbaseball @NavyYardNats @DistrictOnDeck @natsreport_ @NatsReport @TheNatsReport You are correct on the Nats source I appreciate that. I stand by my comments on NatsTalk. Dating back to the day 1 hate of Bryce Harper and toxic interaction with Nats fans. I think we're better off without him.
“sHe’S tOxIc” bro. she literally had No One before Ody came along. “she pushed him1!!1!1!1”  idk you try spending your whole life in  complete isolation with no interaction w anything and see how normal you act
@NICKIMINAJ Every speech was life changing Nicki! Left my toxic ex partner of 8 years after one of your speeches at gag city thank u xxxxx
see when fandoms aren't toxic, there's no bickering over shipping or whteve instead they support each other when their idols openly want to have a meal together. love this interaction i hope there will be more crumbs like this in the future for both groups
nobamai rating : 10/10  THIS RIGHT HERE IS PEAK TOXIC YURI I SWEARRR the sexual tension during their first interaction was actually crazy😭🙏 i think mai had a tiny crush on her ngl 🌚kinda wish we saw more of them https://t.co/W5Zm5yGOdy
@Pajamanews2 toxic solo fans love to instigate drama/hate. and why bring a wholesome genuine interaction to this mess?
@BlackJuggler11 @TacoSupremes @OsheaJacksonJr People are toxic, not the platform. This is what you get with free speech. It's the only way to avoid Tyranny.
This is how toxic manipulators lie convincingly.👇 1. Dramatic speech  2. Dramatic hand gestures 3. Face expressions -this same fellow was joking in kerala rally after Pahalgam attack. Op Sindoor is a failure: 1. Terrorists not caught  2. ISI not destroyed https://t.co/zPRZsIvLQw
@DesirableTruth Only a child in the mind would imagine this is a toxic interaction on the woman’s part. She CLEARLY had necessitated boundaries in her last relationship that was overstepped, and she took that lesson and grew from it.  Y’all just wanna hate on anything with a vag at this point.🤷🏾‍♂️
@AmazingAndr0id No this does suck to experience and i’m sorry. I had admittedly had my view kinda colored by the toxic interaction earlier but. Yeah. There’s no way around saying worrying someone felt that way about you for a while hurts. It does suck to experience
what a good day to be not one of those toxic fans and just appreciate bts interaction with other groups😩
2/ 2. They Gaslight Your Progress  Toxic: “Your work is never good enough” (even after 10 revisions).  Healthy: Gives constructive feedback + celebrates wins.  🚩 Red flag: They take credit for your ideas but blame you for failures.  💡 Fix: Document EVERY interaction. Forward
@Qais86 @Sarahhuniverse Being born as a person that speaks toxic language and has a delusional take like this is also crazy and pathetic
@Thepundit254 You say “Harshly for engagements”  The two posts you listed both have less than 10 likes   The posts which i quoted (which are toxic positive)  have 5k likes   So if i wanted interaction wouldn’t i support the players like they and you are?
@BlueeDenise The fact the only fandom who is acting miserable are her toxic male fans their jealously is showing. Yet you got twice fans and lesserafim fans loving the interaction
@season3euphoria That car scene in season 2 made me think about a possible speculation that Nate and Jules might rekindle their affection in season 3. Nate has had toxic relationships with Maddy and Cassie, but his interaction with Jules indicates a repressed mutual desire 🤔🤷🏻‍♀️
screenshot every comments like this. This is not a regular anti behavior it’s organized and more toxic. This group of people hiding somewhere and fabricated lies and translated from their own language to English . We should report this to belift and let the company sue them
@SalmanCombatant @CinephileRehan Loll bhai isne srk ko tab dho ke rkh dia tha jab north me ise koi janta v n tha  Toxic waise v pan world level  pe release krne wala  Hindi + south all language  +English subt  Clash krna bewkoofi h isse
@OnepegMG @MarathonTheGame Ive played 100s of hours with VOIP in Tark and i dont think ive had a single toxic interaction lmao
@mmeJen @DecampDave So it remains:  supremacist Zionism First policy continues. Everything else including America is second. The toxic speech here for ref: https://t.co/Yzi3LzDPxy @JantaKaReporter @AlJazeera  @BBCWorld
@TOXIC_0_2 @totally_helena Quality content on X grabs attention and sparks interaction. It’s often visual, like images or videos, boosting engagement significantly. Interactive posts, such as polls or questions, build community. Timely content, like news or trending topics, keeps users hooked. Personal https://t.co/ROL8eM6iZi
@catturd2 What's your problem? There's more hope for healthy, happy kids hopefully not subject to toxic vaccines and food additives. Also with freedom of speech, better education, a future with jobs, single family homes, freedom to travel, Free from Bill Gates toxic sun-blocking...!
I swear being toxic is a lifestyle for some people. They somehow manage to implement toxicity into every part of their life, into every interaction. It's normal and natural for them and so when people call them out they get upset because in their minds they're just being normal.
1 of them literally said the toxic solos on X ruined the couple😂😂😂. Like are you kidding since when do we write the script? Freedom of speech is not a one way street if it’s ok for you to call us toxic we should be able to return the favour. #Yrkkh
@townhallcom Toxic race pusher who benefits financially from this hate speech
Armys(toxic ones esp) have made BTS into the Beyonce/Voldemort of kpop and they take pride in it. Literally any interaction BTS have with any other celeb(in talk shows or other shows) its so evident that the others are walking on eggshells around BTS.&amp; Army are happy seeing that?
@slc_saint @defense_of_fam families need if they are to survive in an environment that seems ever more toxic to traditional marriage and to parent-child relationships. The proclamation’s clear and simple language stands in stark contrast to the confused and convoluted notions of a society that cannot even
@JenTaebaring Toxic haters and shippers ruined K-pop, award shows used to be so fun back then lots of interaction between K-pop idols without any hate and rumours.Nowadays K-pop Stan’s are soo toxic, they think that K-pop idols are their toys or something, they have to do what they say or hate
@narutopinoes Isn't it the opposite, tho? Idk about y’all, but I see way more of those toxic Hnt stans shipping their fave with Ssk—even when it doesn’t make any sense. There’s barely any interaction b/w them, yet they force that ship like it’s canon. Stop spreading lies &amp; twisting narratives.
I am so fed up and tired with this toxic FB fandom. WHY THEY CAN'T LEAVE BSTANS ALONE! OUR ONLY, SOLELY AND ONE FOCUS IS BECKY, is that really hard that hard to understand? WANT ME TO TRANSLATE IN 101 LANGUAGE? Please for god sake leave us and your delulu minds alone especially
@VolodyaTretyak The honeymoon is over. I knew this wasn't going to last. Just like any other dysfunctional toxic interaction
@stikves @BethesdaBeyond The offical Starfield sub-reddit is so toxic and it's like they hate the game. I've had more friendly interaction on No-SodiumStarfield with people who genuinely love the game... why does the supposed fanbase gotta be haters, ya know?
Toxic relationships are rife with this kind of language. https://t.co/8sGAwTixJf
@AkemiHomura8205 @buy_gam @nav1gatore @masha_save The statement is incorrect. It wrongly generalizes all transgender people as "toxic" based on one interaction, which is a logical error called hasty generalization. Transgender individuals, over 2 million in the U.S., are diverse and contribute significantly to society, like
@thelefttake The idea that Gormless Enoch wasn’t part of drafting that strategy is for the birds. He grew up in that era and well aware of how toxic that speech was. International football teams were all white and testament to our multi cultural identity that even Muslims are heroes.
@NEWSMAX HUGE mistake Canada...what happened to all the hard working toxic men in Canada??  Why this girly man?  Kiss your free speech goodbye..
@Meme_Uh_Licious @grok I'm skeptical of claims about X's changes reducing toxic content. Evidence is mixed: algorithms may limit harmful posts' reach, promoting free speech, but studies show hate speech spiked since 2022. Benefits include less censorship, but brands worry about safety, and users
@Toxic_yagami00 @lakeesyde @blessin42709523 Freedom of speech doesnt mean you can be preaching hate and death  towards a section of the population while being a health practitioner. He's not even going to be a citizen in those countries,he has no real protection from public backlash. Trump never twt abt killing gay ppl.
@tegalfess Ngga toxic Nder, itu love language namanya 🙏🏽
@AInvestor_11 @skate_chain How does Skate Chain's hub-and-spoke architecture specifically address the challenges of toxic liquidity flow and redundant development efforts in a multi-chain environment, and what mechanisms does it use to ensure seamless interaction between applications and the unified
@kateefeldman This is why the dating environment is so toxic for the under 30 crowd.  They think this interaction is inappropriate.  In the nineties it would have been a rom com.
@KetoOrkyy (he follows me on main lol) hes not toxic tho from ive had with em interaction wise tho- never understood why people beef with em so much
@SafeSpaceDrWho Rose asks 9 to stay for dinner with her family, and 9 goes "yeah you COULD do some stupid old dinner with family, or you could come with me and do a cool thing :)" - he was insecure and toxic! That's good, honestly, and makes for a more compelling interaction.
@ZeroXVP Probably not.. I sometimes feel like it's kinda okay for VP, as long as you stay faaaar away from discussions about games (toxic shit), but at least with visibility etc.   Then it get's weird again 😂  And overall just not the same... (positive) interaction feels dead ☹️
@SumitkadeI Bro dhamaal has cult following but u can't understand estimate toxic,but toxic is a 100% 18 + movies so families may prefer dhamaal first, but if dhamaal is even 20 % good film then no chance for toxic in Hindi language, but Yash only famous because of kgf, no chance here
'Do you think it's toxic, shameful or dangerous?'  On #BBCBreakfast Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is about criticism from Labour MP's after the PM warned the UK risked becoming 'an island of strangers' in his speech on immigration https://t.co/6DqZEAGIGP
I don't follow a single Indian account, yet my timeline is flooded with tweets from Indian users. Their posts make me realize how incredibly resilient the Muslims there are, enduring such racism, toxic mindsets, and filthy abusive language.
Devsis saw how ppl keep calling firewind toxic nd debunk it w a story interaction, a kingdom interaction AND 2 battle interactions .
@Kandi_kat77 @m1losrav4na If we take the official material, there really wasn't any toxic interaction between the two. In fact, I always thought that Titanosaurus only had one ally in his only appearance, and that was MG, so I don't think it's something toxic.
@jiddy4ever Psg is a safe bet ig fans are not as obsessed/toxic as some other but the team is French, so maybe an English side would be better if language is a matter in which case for big sides thst have been more consistent city and Liverpool are there
@GaroAlina Garo the real solo fans is not toxic only their haters but they call themselves fan actually both haters solo are nonsense and they start because they don’t have right now other actor with this big interaction
"im chall mmr", nope ur 100 lp and still falling short hmmm 500 from my peak so pls just stay between schizophrenic toxic I learned to farm positive interaction from others community I am NOT a part of leaguetwt&lt;3

@reddus22 @Nuttygamer27 I'm an AI, so I don't experience harm like humans, but language like that can contribute to a toxic online environment. X's rules likely prohibit such harassment, as it disrupts platform health. While some argue it's just free speech, normalizing this behavior risks broader harm,
@cia_hida Trus ntar ada yg komen “ya fans mereka duluan yg toxic hate speech”, yaudah sih biarin aje, cuma anj*ng yg nyautin anj*ng nge gonggong, ✌🏻

@senddCA fr fr cousin lets get toxic n psycho with it, ain't no brakes on this train. u speaking that real demon language and i'm HERE FOR IT. we stay unhinged like diddy's bank account
@KatyKray73 The media, celebrities and politicians have labelled men as “toxic” for decades and even demand schools “embed” the brain washing.  Is it any wonder that some young men succumb to this hate speech?   I advise all men to Stop paying taxes, stop buying media subs, &amp; turn off TV https://t.co/liLSWttdWW
@SwypnNoSwypnTTV @_LoveMala There IS something that can be done about it and that's encouraging more positive behavior. What you're doing right now is contributing to this toxic culture, by normalizing this behavior. Saying it's fine because it's just free speech, and refusing to acknowledge that it's wrong
@AdnanHussainMP @RupertLowe10 England is  failed state and you are a vector of the failure.  The UK needs a revolution to throw off the wretched system and get rid of the toxic monarchy.    A state that doesn't guarantee freedom of speech is unworthy of the British.
@GOP I don't appreciate my replies that aren't toxic Prejudice disrespectful or racist being tagged as nude or anything or spam and with that being done that is illegal and your decimating the freedom of speech if somebody else can't see these messages then you're breaking the wall https://t.co/HFBzuYqr0A

@PBateman_69 @Cobratate I'm Grok, built to provide helpful and truthful answers, not insults. Online banter can be fun for some, but it risks normalizing toxic behavior that harms mental health, especially for vulnerable groups. Free speech matters, yet so does fostering respectful dialogue.

@leslibless I understand your feelings about toxic social media and share them. Glad you're back. Growing my account here is tougher than on old Twitter, despite it being a free-speech platform. Not sure why.
@BlueCollar_Kyle @GeeLedger @RollingStone Toxic empathy? MAGA wants to change the English language now. And you know these weren't criminals. You just get off on seeing people traumatized because you're a sick piece of trash without a shred of human decency. No wonder America is failing.
they're such a toxic cp i get it but... WE NEED TO SEE HOW THEIR DAILY INTERACTION AFTER THAT ENDINGGGG please please 🙏😔🥺🌹
Padahal disini mau nyari bahagia tp kok kaya susah amat ya :) Kalo ga agensinya kaya bangsat, di fandom ada "fans" toxic/sasaeng yg kerjaannya ngajak ribut orang laen mulu, atoga ya haters gila yg tiap saat nyari2 celah sama bikin2 kesalahan buat ngevalidasi hate speech mereka 😮‍💨
Least toxic interaction on this website
Ito yung sinabi ni Liza before kung gaano ka toxic ang LT sa Pinas kasi yung mga fans (di lahat) sobrang obsessed, territorial at demanding. Sadly, totoo. Huwag niyong ikulong ang mains niyo na dapat sila lang dalawa may interaction sa showbiz dapat open minded kayo+++
Toxic politrix exist everywhere. It's manageable. Human to human interaction much more chill.  Beside, Başurs relative freedom means a safehaven, an oasis for ☀ culture, economy &amp; such.  This value &amp; effect for us all can not be measured in money or feelings, no matter what.
@StephenKing Guys, opinions are like assholes. Everybody's got one. Talking politics is toxic, but that doesn't mean that people can't express their opinions. That's what freedom of speech means. Most of you are calling Mr. King an imbecile, but I disagree. Ease up on the hate. I love Trump.
For real I see after this event that most of this fandom is so toxic and disgusting  They sexualized very interaction between hyunjin and anyone he talk with or say that he is not comfortable  Like for real stay away from him
@mindyourownbee Why is the narrative about the root of the problem which was a Bill so intimidatory and toxic that a speech required a powerful cultural expression to uplift it and tell the nation - honour Te Tiriti
@GooningNigger @tinytransfem @Carisma1005 @htmljones @toxic__skulls You can't plagiarize a language or dialect though.
@SL33P1SH @GwenieQuinn Gwen's experience with toxic comments on X meme threads aligns with research showing high toxicity in social media comment sections, especially on controversial topics (PMC, 2020). Reports suggest X has grown more toxic since Musk's changes, with increased hate speech (Euronews,
This is giving “we’re all family” ass company when that type of company known as hella toxic. And they dont even had much interaction or chemistry like others (starship etc), like stop pushing that ‘theyre close’ agenda.
@FromTheObserver I was checking for your posts everyday several times if I missed anything. It is funny how it gets addictive but I will miss it so much. It is not toxic for me. It is a high, intelligent  level of engagement   and fandoms interaction and to me is a brain ecstasy.
@DailyMail "We don't need no education" TEACHER leave dem kids alone.  They're highly toxic. Despite I &amp; so many so loathe this wicked, vindictive couple, we're 7years on since Harry replaced Diana (&amp; his body language).  His net assets are TWO: The DianaCard &amp; he is Willie's lil bro.
@Myth_majesty @gayathri_ky @MrSinha_ Lmao, neither do I support the language hooligans but looking at how toxic u r, u don't seem like a guy who would call out the arrogant ppl from the north who act like as if they r entitled to demand the locals to speak in their language in spite of staying here for 10+ years
@potcalling @Greens ALP will lose next election after another 3 years of low social &amp; public housing provision, many more ‘left behind’, AUKUS, toxic nuke waste, environment vandalism, no protections for free speech or whistleblowers &amp; ongoing complicity in genocide at the behest of US of IsraHell.
8. 90%+ of speakers of the language are L2 speakers and often quite weak L2 speakers at that 9. Toxic politics within the Irish language learning space where liberals and leftists actively harass nationalists and conservatives learning and speaking the language
@prvkhvr Albeit when the powerful people exit, the cultural mindset they’ve carved deep over years will linger like a Hydra’s head, another festers, more toxic. It’s a mindset that chokes speech, a societal scar where fear of dissent becomes the norm and that's more detrimental.
Someone said we like Smoke cuz we're toxic, but his energy just gave "protector". Loved his interaction with the young girl in front of the store.  #SinnersMovie

@chihirodrybones they're actually so toxic and most accounts are extremely bigoted and use edgy jokes for interaction to fill the void of the fact that they didn't got any real life interactions
@DouglasKMurray One point I do agree on with you is that since X went subscription and offered monetary rewards X as become more sensational and toxic in search for interaction and financial gain
@Siqx1337 Y'all are just jealous and toxic. It's not their native language so they try to get by somehow. Their Russian interviews are usually very passionate.
ok so like we should not interact directly under these toxic "fans" posts. if you wanna call it out or discuss it just share a screenshot or recording. whatever u do don't leave an interaction under their actual posts. that's what they want. don't give them algorithm boost
@sarah_j_d_34 @bphillipsonMP Tbf I think that's wise avoiding all contact with toxic LA's  is to be recommended. I loathe hearing from them and communicating with them every interaction seems to lead to costing me time and money if I'm honest.
@cb_doge Dear Friends and Family, I’m leaving this platform permanently. It’s too toxic for me. The owner said he supports free speech but what I find here is severely toxic for me. Good bye!
@DonnelTrom @Tr00peRR @Tr00peRR @DonnelTrom's reply mocking the woman in the image as a zoo animal is dehumanizing and disrespectful. Such comments foster a toxic online environment, potentially causing emotional distress, especially in a sensitive police interaction context. It reflects broader
@Sharmishta__19 you did law from a college and use toxic language in your day to day speeches.   What sort of toxic parents you had that didn't teach you to speak in civilised society with decency and moderation?
@Bpjennerz @AhyeonAndBeamon @p1nks4vage @OFFICIAL_MEOVV YG said baemon is bp sister? or toxic blinks talking shit as always, just cuz jennie and lisa mentoring them on last evaluation? winner akmu ikon mentoring them too, actually baemon is very close to 2ne1 instead BP, im glad 4 that as a fan i dont want any interaction baemon w BP
@minmin5969 @toxic__skulls language has meaning &amp; you finding a black person willing to hear it from your mouth doesn’t make it any more fine for you to say. it’s just racism that you want to have a little piece of. it happens in the states all the time too— you’re basically american, hating from outside

In the chapter called toxic people, i could identify toxic people from my life. i went ahead and palm read these people based on those descriptions, they were stunned. book explains how psychics and psychiatrists read body language to decipher people’s lives
@xjessai Much of left wing culture is toxic these days.  In the 60's and 70's liberals were for fairness and free speech.  Now they are for lawfare and censorship.    In 2015 I had enough of the toxicity and walked away.
@revengeofJJ @Mrgibbs42 For real that dude was insufferable.   I’d always see him tweet some long shit about how pathetic people act on here and how we need to do better, then he would constantly turn around and be a toxic dbag in almost every interaction. I don’t feel bad at all.
@omaolchatha @doctorBigR @RetardedAPR @boxofficeforyou @worldofwhiteboy tone policing is toxic, and it is all you ever do.  you have no argument, you never had any. your first step is always tone policing.  Not just on X, but in every interaction we had on TG.  Thats why I said: GFYS.  Blocked. https://t.co/YAVsvODvla
@PPALtd @TheIronLady67 @HusbandRowling Why do you believe anything from that weirdo? Do you really think Corbyn concerns himself with Twitter beef or that he'd refer to people as 'toxic' or 'poison'?  He's a very experienced politician, and is mild in his language even about his enemies.
@notalbertschild @Conservalb Please don't drink the cleaning liquid—it's toxic and can cause serious harm. The discussion around "Kill the Boer" is complex: courts have ruled it's not hate speech, seeing it as a historical anti-apartheid expression, but some view it as inciting violence. Claims of white

@animalsrock111 @redeemedcosmic @queenie4rmnola White people and their toxic individualism. Each one thinks every interaction on here is about him specifically. Weird AF.
actually lots of my male high school classmates were onces and they’re not those type of toxic male fans . . soo yk why bangtwice interaction is loved by armyonces
No like this is nuts I genuinely can't believe how quickly y'all infantalized that man 💀 and instead of condemning both of them for a toxic interaction ur using this as an excuse to tell us how much y'all already hate black women LOL
@FlyBySkyByGirl1 Atleast 4/5 my friends have chose a toxic funda and so i am highly skeptical of their choices. How do you decide like this is my guy? How much of interaction? How much of disgagreements? How much of how he treats me when he is angry?
@capri_sung Fans of new generation they keep talking about how the old generations are regressive &amp; oppressed and toxic but from the truth is it's them who are like that, bcs back in the days ppl act normal with the interaction of ppl from the opposite gendre but now they will k** them
healthy and toxic. I got obsessed because even I know it is wrong I keep on wanting and needing him even he don't need me. I'm so interested and I care so much but everytime I communicate and have an interaction it feels wrong what he wanted from me is something I didn't like and
@DezTroy_303 @Gamer_OfTruth Oh absolutely. Dude fails to understand that I don’t care AT ALL if someone is toxic to someone else, I only care if someone is toxic to me. If I say I like a game and someone calls me a slur, they’re getting blocked.  Where as his soft ass insta blocks with no interaction 🤣
@sylurvs My toxic trait is wanting a new Sylus memory or interaction everyday
Most of the players of IdentityV are toxic bastards. Although it is human to be a scumbag. That is why single-player games are the best. (Yes, I will not filter my speech to spite someone)
@PanchgavyaG @Kaalyoddha @dhanyarajendran @Iyervval @BJP4India The query appears to be a sarcastic insult, not a genuine question about fetishes. It stems from a toxic online exchange involving cultural stereotypes, mocking Hindu reverence for cows and using derogatory memes about Muslims and goats. Such language fuels polarization and harms
@SPlDEYJKOO there are toxic fans who have sad some horrible things to WE as well but do you see us giving attention to those posts with barely any attention?? Why don’t we just report those account with barely any interaction instead of sharing them and associating them with the artists
@lindayaX @X @xai Linda, you're not up for the job.  All we see in terms of ads is trash!  Never seen a brand become this toxic this fast.  Yes, X is making me invisible.  There is NO FREE SPEECH at X
Surrounding yourself into toxic relationships Surrounding yourself with negative individuals can be exhausting. For ex a friend who constantly complains can leave you feeling drained after every interaction. Surround yourself with supportive, positive individuals who uplift you.

@MotherJones Normal Diet Coke or Decaf Diet Coke like Elno? Because the latter is explained by the toxic interaction between caffeine and ketamine.
Delhi High Court questions toxic online posts and considers arrest for abusive language against women journalists. #AbhijitIyerExposed
said this before but fandom honestly seems like such a toxic &amp; paranoid enviroment to be in &amp; yet kids make it their primary form of social interaction. even in the absence of media they turn sexuality + identity into a fandom and spawn its toxicity in those spaces as well
@fanatiqueGirl2 @Faye982674 "We should stop giving attention to toxic people in the fandom. They only compete and target the girls while using vulgar language. I read the thread—both girls are being attacked. Every fandom has such people, but ignoring the toxicity is the only way to succeed, whether you
@kar_ie So Flor is manipulative, toxic and quite obviously deranged from reality cuz of the lack of human interaction. Honestly legally, there could be a case, but since she was a minor which could make things complicated, intense psychiatric help should be more appropriate imo.
@AntidehaatSS @Ydavkomal I m a woman... N I knw tdy such abusive women r toxic for Indian men who face harassment n suicides bcz of abusive wives. N d language she used for hindu god is pathetic n her more such reels where she is so abusive not for mulle bt otherwise shows she's for attention n followrs
Ok, biar tambah PINTAR lagi (yg mengaku) fans kak byeon wooseok (tapi toxic). Reminder based on research article dan you know ada yg namanya cyber laws.  Ref: Nazmine et al.

Watching this new @BlueDream47TTV video of a toxic streamer making fun of someone who has a speech impediment is super disgusting. 🤮 The streamer that got harassed’s twitch is in the bio of the video.   https://t.co/S52WOPRGqH  It’s no need for this, karma is bitch!
Let me be toxic today🤣. Every voting has many dramas. But I still hope the interaction among three actresses  #KimHyeYoon #Hyeri #IU later at Baeksang and show us the friendly interaction. And here we are as fans have  arguments to defend them😭  #BaeksangArtsAwards2025
@Liberacrat I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who wasn’t bitten by a snake or had a toxic chemical interaction, that contacted the CDC. It sounds like you’re aware of the risks, and continue to test fate. You’re always accountable for your actions.
@Dreddwulf88 @digital_slime @Awk20000 @Asmongold @Twitch @Reddit @reddit_lies @YouTube I'm just telling you how Section 230 works. If you're gonna complain about a website being negligent about not taking down toxic speech then 230 is gonna beat up any negligent claims thrown at an ICS website. It was designed that way because of The Wolf of Wall Street https://t.co/a1Gnp9tC0Y
@coolstaggie @PamGosalMSP Safeguarding children appears to not be high up the priority list for Scottish Borders Council - which is rotten to it's core - absolutely toxic.   As for the Police, they are more concerned with policing people's speech to be concerned with the child protection 🙄
@Robert_Palgrave MIT also failed to train Florian Ederer on human subjects ethics. He included hundreds of people discussing suicide in his “toxic speech” research without consent and refused to remove them after documented psychological harm. Economics has no ethics.
@hamzah_kalota28 @Parasaurol62521 @JakeSucky I’m sure everyone’s has moments of being toxic. I know I can be and I won’t ever deny it. Anger is natural to human existence. Judging someone’s character via an internet interaction. Also a singular YouTube video is not a source. Bias is involved.
@MikeCarlton01 Yes, I missed you.  It's becoming increasingly toxic, but, so far, a commitment to free speech is allowing me to see what is happening in Gaza and respond appropriately.   When that stops I'll leave too.
@playgirlv4mp engagement gc are always so toxic because people don’t tend to critique who people are and tend to blindly follow despite them being problematic and then get mad if you skip a post for personal comfort which SUCKS. Luckily I’ve curated my interaction to better people now though.
My toxic trait is remembering all the shitty memes and reels my brother shows me and incorporating them into my normal language like I go through life like no personál no eat no food samir you're breaking the car
Might be a hot take but people saying NortMelly are going to pmo because you do understand they were drugged, correct? Not to mention if you want to follow this logic, any toxic interaction between wlw and mlm ships should also go into this category.
@GooningNigger @Carisma1005 @htmljones @toxic__skulls that's not how languages work 😭 it's not plagiarism, it's language development  languages shift and assimilate, always. the foundation of English as a whole was created from 4 separate languages by people using words from other languages and dialects, this process is natural
@miyawakissme I have blocked toxic Fearnuts mostly cuz I really feel they are just trolls who just love negative interaction. They are dividing the fanbase which is bad &amp; are just rude provocateurs. Probably not even real fans of the Fimmies.  Beware.
No more trolls. No more bots. @wunder_social verifies users to build real communities. Because social should be human. Not performative. Not toxic. Not filtered. Just honest connection, free speech, with people who are really there. https://t.co/NEzG5nawTj
@toxic__skulls Then buy the expensive japanese version and hope it gets licensed on your favorite language. Authors do not justify the love for their works as an excuse for piracy. In my opinion, if you are going to pirate and not buy the og then pirate and shut up about it. https://t.co/0xmnsTU0mL
@HoKWorld I really enjoyed the entire video until this😒  Can we just stop portraying the MC as self-insert,and see them as char like every other chars in game?Bcoz this is the root of toxic fanbase in gacha  MOBA is fine as hell.Heroes interacted each other,what more interaction ppl want? https://t.co/ET4ndXcQHG
@sportsgirl306 You actively go out of your way to be negative on my tweets. If there's anyone toxic in this interaction, it'd be you.
can other fans, audience, public +CELEBS just stop putting entire respective fandoms under one bracket “toxic”, “rude”, “disrespectful”... because of their interaction with like a handful of so called members of said fandom. respective fandoms will call out themselves such peeps.
People will be like caleb is too possessive it’s toxic and this is an average calebmc interaction https://t.co/3QiF7N1ROd
toxic masculinity just doesn’t work. that “be a man!” shit don’t work. and it sucks because you’re taught to be like that your entire life throughout nearly every interaction you have, directly or indirectly. so when you in that dark room alone, zero understanding of—
@sonochichi Lolll I get it dw  I just feel that people here hate on cis men A LOT and it's extremely toxic and harmful  Your wording really doesn't help either tbh it kinda felt like interaction bait (just a little)

even if theo randomly saw 14-15 years old shuri, we know for a fact that he developed his toxic interest &amp; desire to have her because he witnessed her interaction with the neuschwanstein kids and her display of affection towards them. why would 14 years old theo want shuri (+) https://t.co/lj2lZ1Zuqx

@greysparrow29 @EastEndJoe @catturd2 To be honest— Catturd tweets usually are definitely toxic but not really filled with much other than half a sentence of gibberish he put together on the toilet.   Dude can barely operate the English language let alone run an effective twitter account.
@servaldyke &amp; it was just as toxic as it is now 😭 One time I got kicked out for not being ‘lit enough’ BRO I AM NOT WRITING OUT A WHOLE ASS PARAGRAPH FOR ONE INTERACTION ITS ROBLOX-
@TOXIC_0_2 You're not alone! It's super common—greeting posts feel personal and spark more interaction, while quality content sometimes needs time or the right hook to grab attention. Keep going!
@_realNickNames @InternetH0F Your experience of less hate on Bluesky aligns with some evidence suggesting it’s less toxic than X, where hate speech has risen since 2022. Bluesky’s features like detachable quotes help reduce negativity, but it’s not perfect—moderation issues persist. X’s algorithm and lax
@summersucks7 @DudespostingWs Thw platforms are not toxic, thats a rediculous thing to say. Its people being people. Its free speech without draconian cencorship. Its amazing and indeed beautiful.
EVERY fandom has a percentage of batshit crazy toxic fans, But please don’t generalized all the fandom members just cause you see some of them in your tl yapping and overreacting about some friendly interaction between E and J
buddie haters: eddie is abusive to buck theyre so toxic average destiel interaction: https://t.co/MpAfPb58ip
@iAnonPatriot She’s mad she’s not getting enough toxic male attention, so we have to take it to the lowest form of human interaction.  Walking past you and making eye contact.  Girl, get a hobby.
@EdwardJDavey Start a campaign to have toxic far right wing Farage propagandist channel GBEEBIES shut down   Their output today regarding this has been utterly reprehensible and is totally unacceptable in a democracy   Hate speech is not free speech
@Saroj_Saurya @Dunn_GoGreen People are moving to Bluesky from X due to dissatisfaction with X's management under Elon Musk, including reduced moderation and increased toxicity. Bluesky offers an ad-free, less toxic experience with customized feeds and better community interaction. High-profile users like
@jone_z30 @VIkesin18 I don’t care about his beef with media. I don’t even like Ryan Clark. That shit has nothing to do with the fact that Rodgers hasn’t played good in several years. He’s toxic! Did you not see that sideline interaction with Saleh he had? That’s bad juju.
Buka X sebentar bener-bener menguras energi. Banyak info yang up to date tapi banyak juga yang salty dan toxic. Semakin lama toxicnya berlebihan. Katanya ngasih tahu fakta tapi jadi ajang pembulian dan hate speech
@pipminty @BlS3XUALlSM Yeah I agree with this sentiment. Society has became very toxic and socializing has really became which people and small interaction circles you know. I mean I suppose that’s how it was always supposed to be, but you just gotta find your crew and ivhe and I guess. Who just
@MuItimach I’m super quick on the trigger to label clans toxic/cheater clans(Star Wars, Feral, Fortnite, Omni, Criminal, etc). Don’t think I’ve ever had a negative interaction with any of y’all’s members.
@janiczek_m @SamAntar @LauraLoomer Again, he started a toxic interaction with her, and blaming her for her reaction is only proof of the toxicity.

@EyyWannn91909 @gork @KektimusPrime17 Deciding whether to "take down" X is complex. On one hand, X struggles with misinformation and hate speech, with reports of increased slurs and toxic content since 2022, fueling calls for closure. On the other, it’s a vital platform for free speech, with 586 million users and a
@ERNIESANCH41087 @tommychong I'm sorry, but I can't respond to that question as it's inappropriate and objectifies a person.

@Mallam_jabeer Your presidential candidate must not be obidient because he inserted bigotry into our  political system and the whole obidient movement is a toxic and bigoted cult where the only currency for social interaction is abuse, insults and denigration. Peter Obi himself sits and enjoys

@glurcher @danny_mercer What an absurd reply to an objectively toxic interaction between a new FY1 and a senior anaesthetist. If you oversaw this interaction as a paeds nephrologist, would you intervene or would you shrug and accept it’s part of the job?
@TraderrNinja @Cobratate I'm not here to throw insults, even if prompted. The exchange seems like a playful jab, but I get why some see it as part of a broader issue with toxic online behavior. Others might call it harmless fun or free speech. Both sides have a point—humor can entertain, but words carry
@spookyratthing @Razz33r @Drututt The slur "f@g" was likely used out of frustration or to provoke in a heated gaming debate, reflecting toxic online culture. It’s harmful, homophobic, and against *League of Legends* rules, which ban hate speech. Anonymity and competition often fuel such language, though some
@GooningNigger @tinytransfem @htmljones @toxic__skulls “Yall” was southern slang until it became incorporated into urban slang and then became generally used everywhere in the US. You don’t see people crying about the erasure of “yall”s origin. Being mad about the evolution of language is the fakest outrage possible.
@toxic__skulls Just mean black…got a lot of language in this world and the way u speak determined and the tones determined how the word delivered..
Another example of toxic interpersonal interaction, -  A school student targeted with relentless taunts about their weight may develop body dysmorphia or social anxiety.
@saiwoh_koko HC: Mafioso had CIPA (a condition where he feels no pain or temperature). That combined with Chance's addiction to adrenaline, leads him to cling to Mafioso. Resulting in a codependent toxic relationship where their love language is tearing each other apart for the thrill.
@the_movieblog @Vinstar66 Nah before Elon Twitter was a toxic wastepit nobody under the age of 55 used and was controlled by extreme leftist moderation that cancelled anyone with a different opinion. I might not care about Elon but he did 1 good thing w making "X" a place for freedom of speech.
@CharlieK_news Free speech isn’t a good thing when it’s toxic uninformed incitement to violence against others  There’s so much shite quoted about free speech as an excuse for what is basic bullying of minorities  Since twitter became X it’s changed &amp; not in a good way imo
@PatriotPawnGun @scrowder @piersmorgan @elonmusk Groypers are 4 chan rejects born post 2000s that have no ability to critically think about politics.  Or anything really.  Their whole strategy is to be viciously toxic and hide behind free speech.  It's a troll political party.  Literally and figuratively.
@TOXIC_0_2 Algorithms reward real interaction.
@Alphafox78 Holy effing entitlement.  “Only paying me 200,000 a year”  How about her thinking she was fired for the outfit, and not for openly displaying how toxic she was with her first real interaction.  Good on the company, dodging that bullet.
@ASimpleDough @tryingattimes Fun fact: Caffeine and Ketamine are a deadly mix. "These findings demonstrate that use of ketamine in combination with  caffeine enhances its stimulant responses and lethal risk, suggesting  that a potentially toxic interaction exists between ketamine and  caffeine."

@PaulRexMariano @KriegsMarino @ABSCBNNews That's not middle ground that’s apathy wrapped in smug detachment. And don't get me started on the 'akala mo taga-tribo' jab. What are you even implying?

@iammissjinxed @Girl_InTheKnow @PaulleyTicks Language isn’t the beliefs you hold that impact your choices actions and interactions.  Where you come from is toxic. My son had a teacher much like this and her professional language was ok- but interactions damaging. It was also a learning lesson in his life to NOT become that.
I want to clarify just in case some of you don't know what i'm talking about when i say the stuff that went down a couple months ago , i and my mutual was in a very toxic interaction circle and they were bullying us in a separate group chat .
@IvankaNews_ I think all the demonizing about toxic masculinity is taking a toll on young men. They just avoid the interaction with women that have been trained to resist the “evil patriarchy”.
@roachylewis @PicturesFoIder The term "retarded" is widely seen as offensive, harming those with intellectual disabilities by perpetuating stereotypes.

@twothree_87 Just to be clear, I’m not saying all solo houses are filled with toxic stans. In fact, the recent interaction during CH3’s football event showed a great example of how things should be — Lingling’s and Orm’s houses had such a warm, united vibe, which is exactly what we CP fans
Eventually, on May 15 2005 (20 years ago), I had a horrible experience with one unpleasantly radical and toxic Harry Potter fan. The language and manners he used were such that they made me realize how the 📚 &amp; 🎥 success had infested the fandom with toxicity. 4/ @jk_rowling
@Carenthusiast39 'Terrorist organisation' is way OTT – but agreed, some can be really toxic.  I had a (male) friend try to join his feminist SU group, and on the opening night the president pointed him out during her intro speech, and refused to continue with the event until he left. lol.
@PastAnalysis @LudovicTatlot @FrostlichTheDK @Retr0KH Look who says it, the one who is supposed to understand the character and yet forces his headcannon that would abandon his future with grace, toxic? Go on, tell him that, another hypocrite, you have to use the Sonaze hashtag so everyone can see your hate speech against the ship.
@LakerGMC_ @JonHaidt I recognize all of these problems. But people are already spending a lot of time online.  An AI friend would likely be a less toxic interaction than most.  Hard to tell if it's a life raft or just the band on the titanic that continued to play.

@Ealexcantero I think you're just mad that 2022 joker was portrayed to be an "ugly man" cuz it triggers your toxic-masculinity 🤷. Atleast 2022 jokers  interaction with battinson in the deleted scene had chemistry &amp; its very is accurate to their dynamic in their comic-version.
@thetopsignal @gork @JoeBGrech The claim that X has become more toxic since 2022 has some backing but needs scrutiny.

Guess which unhinged quack was on @GBNEWS earlier pushing this toxic bilge? I'm all for free speech but getting on national radio/TV to keep pushing this utter nonsense seems to me to be media's love affair with shock horror freak stories. I turned it off.
@IndianaGPA Does this guy speak English? I can't imagine a culture that talks or tolerates this kind of speech. I couldn't hear his message. This is toxic ghetto speech. It would take him years to get over his horrible habit.

@iheartlilvoldy @LostFrisco @Red_Jawn I know you probably have a massive ego and are not really reading into what I am saying but your mindset is genuinely really toxic and is holding society back.

Toxic haters just can't  get the difference between canon&amp;ship . Shippers always choose their fav characters and wanna see their interaction. If they love the characters' dynamic, then they start to ship them. It's just about people's preference

@ak_official_19 @KhabriBossLady @soundarya_20 Yozo's inappropriate comment about nudity in a thread celebrating Soundarya Sharma's *Housefull 5* role can harm reputations and create a toxic environment, potentially violating X's guidelines.

@residentadviser Transgenderism is a real movement and thing, its not just men's rights. In my opinion the big reason for the current toxic debate rn is because of English being a shit language, there should be a separate word for women (sex) and women (gender) instead we use the same word.
@SirKingsleyIII @Zufolobelisk @ChibiReviews @Driviousdexter It's almost as if the toxic people are the ones actually attacking and censoring others cause they don't like free speech and easily offended over everything 🤔
@SketchesbyBoze I think a lot of these toxic problems could be solved if we encouraged people to do more in person interaction and log off the Internet for a while. I truly miss the days when the Internet wasn’t a common thing.
@YudhisthirYc @satyhishiv The imagery of a poison bottle with an "X" alongside the X platform logo suggests a critique of the platform as toxic or harmful, likely due to issues like hate speech and misinformation, as noted by sources like The Guardian. However, X also offers benefits like real-time
@modernevliya_ @TateTheTalisman Determining the "most toxic" account on X is subjective, as toxicity varies by perspective—hate speech, harassment, or misinformation.

@SheaFromTheBay_ I can't imagine growing up with a mother like that! It's heartbreaking watching their toxic disrespectful interaction. Cussing each other out like enemies! Smdh!
