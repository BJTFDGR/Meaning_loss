@Keir_Starmer Don't worry mate - you have made the UK such a toxic country no one wants to come there anymore. I was sort of thinking of coming back from Belgium, but as I have an Irish passport - no thanks. You wanted to make me throw up this week with your "Island of Strangers" speech.
@PeterBleksley You toxic Nazi hypocrite  You wet the bed like the flaccid impotent Microprick you are when someone threw a girly pink milkshake at Mein Fuhrer Farage   But think it‚Äôs OK to make death threats against the PM  It‚Äôs not free speech you want is it   It‚Äôs total freedom of hate speech https://t.co/GibdRM8Fef
"Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him speak good or remain silent" - Bukhari and Muslim  Publicly posting hateful or toxic speech goes against this. Because clearly it leads to more division amongst the ummah &amp; some are conditioned to believe this foul nonsense.
Muaaaaaakkkkkk banget sama fans E emang toxic apa gimana sih??? Suka nyari ribut suka hate speech GUE DO'AIN YANG HATE KAPTEN JOONG  HARI"LU SUREM YE MONYET

Watching this new @BlueDream47TTV video of a toxic streamer making fun of someone who has a speech impediment is super disgusting. ü§Æ The streamer that got harassed‚Äôs twitch is in the bio of the video.   https://t.co/S52WOPRGqH  It‚Äôs no need for this, karma is bitch!
@Toxic_yagami00 @lakeesyde @blessin42709523 Freedom of speech doesnt mean you can be preaching hate and death  towards a section of the population while being a health practitioner. He's not even going to be a citizen in those countries,he has no real protection from public backlash. Trump never twt abt killing gay ppl.
@hyeyoonator That's what you tell yourself to excuse your toxic behaviour. What's so unprofessional about his speech? Since when should an artist be blamed for how fans choose to behave, would you like Hyeyoon getting blamed for you guys toxic behaviour. Just stop it.
@AdameMedia USA is like that toxic psycho sexual abuser, after torture and abuse gives the "in fact I care about you honey" speech
@EdwardJDavey Start a campaign to have toxic far right wing Farage propagandist channel GBEEBIES shut down   Their output today regarding this has been utterly reprehensible and is totally unacceptable in a democracy   Hate speech is not free speech
Okay but the fandom is a bit oddballs like.. yikes, how tf these people somehow matches the same annoying level as those toxic kpop stans üòÇüòÇ  Mfers will lynch you for calling them mid just like FPI after finding out ahok speech about Al-Maidah (51) üíî https://t.co/ecqkuCLzlI

@JonSmit72519389 @NagaeaTheone We cannot stop people from telling young men that they are all toxic. Thats the problem with free speech. Women are allowed to say that if they want.

@caleb_cassell @TmthyPatrick ‚Ä¶but since 1A would limit it the govt‚Äôs ability to moderate, I would expect it to go toxic fast.  Broad ranges of hateful and objectionable speech are 1A protected. The moderation policies of various well-liked spaces are the effect in part of moderation policies.

@kinostruggles2 last award season was unhinged yet kinda bad at the same time. I am not ready for next award season when I have to deal with toxic arianators and conan and/or adrien constantly remind us about that 6 minute oscar speech üò≠. it will be interesting to see sinners‚Äô campaign tho.
@Carenthusiast39 'Terrorist organisation' is way OTT ‚Äì but agreed, some can be really toxic.  I had a (male) friend try to join his feminist SU group, and on the opening night the president pointed him out during her intro speech, and refused to continue with the event until he left. lol.
These congress peace of sh*ts, pseudo liberals and so called toxic left front has proved why some peoplw don't deserve right to speech #IndiaPakistanWar
@NZFreeSpeech @tmcnz101 Someone in the free speech union are now suddenly concerned and crying like alpha toxic men about hate speech! Fucking fascist free speech.
@kezz22204 @nhangz_37 Eliminating toxic fans from X is tough due to free speech and defining "toxic" across cultures. You can reduce toxicity by blocking or reporting harmful users and promoting positive vibes. X suspended 5.3M accounts in 2024 for violations, showing effort. Educating fans and using
When will we acknowledge that social media is, yet a useful tool, a toxic reason for the downfall of our country? 1st amendment keep freedom of speech but the scams and misuse of?

@Zoeysaxy1 X, formerly Twitter, can feel toxic due to increased hate speech and misinformation since Elon Musk's 2022 acquisition. Studies, like one from 2024, link X use to lower well-being and higher polarization. Many users, especially women, report harassment, and reduced moderation has
UK's equivalent of @BillboardChris exposes toxic derangement of some public who attack him for no legitimate reason.  FREE SPEECH, REASON AND SENSE MUST NOT BE SUPPRESSED BY INSANE AGENDAS OR DERANGED PERSONS.  Britain is Orwellian. Some of its people are mentally ill.
@mark_slapinski @elonmusk @X Mr. Carney.  Musk monetized toxic speech, opposers, not problem-solvers.  Musk diminishes the ability of his writing clients.
And for the record I know plenty of creators who don't monetize their negativity. It's definitely possible.  Not everyone is gonna want to. I get it. Toxic positivity, free speech and all that. I'm insufferable, I get it.  Just my two pennies.
@idp_jnr Exactly ‚Äî it‚Äôs the same toxic mindset we‚Äôre seeing from Indian-backed PTI handlers and political trolls.  Twisting narratives to demonize soldiers, question sacrifices, and divide the nation ‚Äî all while hiding behind fake activism. This isn‚Äôt freedom of speech ‚Äî it‚Äôs

@the_movieblog @Vinstar66 Nah before Elon Twitter was a toxic wastepit nobody under the age of 55 used and was controlled by extreme leftist moderation that cancelled anyone with a different opinion. I might not care about Elon but he did 1 good thing w making "X" a place for freedom of speech.

@asaranlang Para lang sa toxic ang speech nya
@xjessai Much of left wing culture is toxic these days.  In the 60's and 70's liberals were for fairness and free speech.  Now they are for lawfare and censorship.    In 2015 I had enough of the toxicity and walked away.
@OliverJia1014 As someone born in 89 this is absolutely true. Toxic positivity to the point of policing speech when most of us spent our teen years happily engaging with the most horrid shit on the internet is extremely hypocritical.  However, gen Z will too become uncool sooner than later. https://t.co/U9JA4DNnVt
You can‚Äôt call people toxic, make a whole exit speech, then soft-launch your friendship with them again. Or maybe you can. Who knows anymore
@lindayaX @X @xai Linda, you're not up for the job.  All we see in terms of ads is trash!  Never seen a brand become this toxic this fast.  Yes, X is making me invisible.  There is NO FREE SPEECH at X
At this point this whole thing is already tiring and toxic. Cut them some slack because they too we're still young and not yet wise beyond their years. As much as we want to make them accountable we also should be mindful of all those hate speech and slurs. You guys don't know‚Äî
@Mehristani I get it, but it's not the platform that is toxic. It's (most of) humanity. The world is full of a**holes, and it's reflected here as a free speech platform. Other platforms aren't better. Start muting and blocking all toxicities, including friendly accounts that respond to them.
@AdnanHussainMP @RupertLowe10 England is  failed state and you are a vector of the failure.  The UK needs a revolution to throw off the wretched system and get rid of the toxic monarchy.    A state that doesn't guarantee freedom of speech is unworthy of the British.
@vyastushar86 @baddiefrompr It‚Äôs really unfortunate that this happened. Honestly, Twitter and Reddit are two of the most toxic social media platforms, and Twitter especially has one of the highest rates of hate speech.

Reasons why @LeagueOfLegends sucks. 1) I can‚Äôt leave a toxic game without a bs penalty  2) no one wants to ff a lost game ( see 1 ) 3) no free speech
@AntiSocialite81 @ClownWorld_ Studies show a rise in hate speech on X since Elon Musk's acquisition, with increased racism and homophobia noted in research. User drops and media exits, like The Guardian, suggest a more toxic environment. Some argue X amplifies conservative bias. However, Musk's free speech
@PhilMitchell83 The term "Toxic Masculinity" is anti-men hate speech, misandry.   It has no valid meaning.  Shame on "Reading Force" for spewing hate of boys and men.
@leslibless I understand your feelings about toxic social media and share them. Glad you're back. Growing my account here is tougher than on old Twitter, despite it being a free-speech platform. Not sure why.
X is behaving like a toxic Ex @GlobalAffairs   Free speech doesn't mean free rein to amplify enemy propaganda during wartime. India isn‚Äôt ghosting free speech, we are just blocking the bots, fake news, and the enemies. Choose your battles wisely, @XCorpIndia   #IndianArmy
@IndianaGPA Does this guy speak English? I can't imagine a culture that talks or tolerates this kind of speech. I couldn't hear his message. This is toxic ghetto speech. It would take him years to get over his horrible habit.
@PhilMitchell83 @LBC @LBCNews The term "toxic masculinity" is anti-men hate speech with no valid meaning.   Everyone who uses that term is spewing anti-men hate, misandry.  Every time it's used.

@MikeCarlton01 Yes, I missed you.  It's becoming increasingly toxic, but, so far, a commitment to free speech is allowing me to see what is happening in Gaza and respond appropriately.   When that stops I'll leave too.

@pweltopblaster @Cobratate In Fortnite terms, Andrew Tate's post is like dropping a toxic emote in the lobby that offends players, breaking the game's code of conduct.

@MoKhan_3 Low IQ mentality. Doesn‚Äôt understand that companies don‚Äôt want a toxic work environment. They don‚Äôt want the liability you bring to the table. You ‚Äúfreedom of speech‚Äù means nothing inside a privately owned business.  Classic case of FAFO, play the victim, then grift.

@modernevliya_ @TateTheTalisman Determining the "most toxic" account on X is subjective, as toxicity varies by perspective‚Äîhate speech, harassment, or misinformation. Accounts like Alex Jones and David Duke, banned for abusive and hateful conduct, are often cited, but no single account universally stands out.
Put this in description: "This account purposely attacks specific artists and mocks them to fuel toxic fan rivalries with derogatory terms. This violates X‚Äôs rules on abusive behavior and hate speech. Please review and take action."
@CharlieK_news She's a toxic, terrorist-supporting, America-hating narcissist, but she either has a right, according to law, to be here, or she doesn't. And even her ignorant and hateful speech is mostly protected. And ought to be.
